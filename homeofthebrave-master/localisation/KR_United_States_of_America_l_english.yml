USA_HOTB_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The United States is in the midst of its worst political turbulence since 1865. Few expected this after America successfully avoided the Weltkrieg but the rise of syndicalism fomented a Red Scare and an economy depressed by nonstop worker strikes and political crackdowns. Herbert Hoover won the 1928 election promising a return to normalcy but with the Great Panic of 1928 occurring he has made no headway and his re-election via the House of Representatives has only damaged his legitimacy. Now US politics is challenged by numerous radical forces, all of whom promise in their own way an end to politics as we know it if elected."

### Leaders ###
POLITICS_HERBERT_HOOVER_DESC:0 "Born in 1874 in West Branch Iowa, Hoover was born into a family of Canadian Quakers settling in the then frontier town of West Branch. Hoover's early life was tumultous, being orphaned at the age of ten, and having to move West to Oregon, where his Uncle, a Quaker physican took him in.n/ Hoover first attended the Freinds Pacific School at the age of 13, but soon lost interest in theology and applied and was accepted into Stanford instead. Hoover soon befreinded the chair of geology, John Branner, and decided to switch his career to geology and mining.n/ After some time as a small manager in the Sierra Nevada's, Hoover was able to pick up a job working for a big London based Australia gold mining company. Hoover made the company a fortune for the company with his scouting, with the company being to able to find and mine half of the gold reserves. Hoover soon found himself as one of the highest ranking men in the Company, with him being promoted to head the Tianjin Concession Gold Mines. Hoover also gained a sour reputation with the workers as a staunch opponent of Minimum Wage or the 8 Hour Workday. However as time went on Hoover softened his beliefs, promoting the 8 hour workday that he had opposed.n/ The company Hoover was working for soon found itself in an insider trading scandal, and was losing law suits left and right. Hoover then jumped ship; becoming an independent consultant in 1909. In 1914, this all changed. Hoover was tasked of heading the America Relif Commission, and soon found himself as the de-facto head of American reflif efforts to Europe. Hoover became a much more public figure because of this, with him even serving with the Wilson administration.n/ After the war, Hoover continued his philantropy and mining consultations, soon earning his way to the hearts of the Republican Party establishment, and becoming the 1928 nominee, to fix the Great Depression and bring America back on her feet.n/ That did not happen.n/ Instead America became even more divided, even worse, and a four party system. After emergency welfare was shot down time and time again by Congress, Hoover barely won the 1932 election for the mere fact that he was an establishment candidate. As 1936 rolls around, Hoover has found himself as a lame duck, bound hostage by the Establishment and forced to listen to the chants of the masses calling for his death."

USA_great_depression_desc:0 "Since the collapse of the New York Stock Market in 1925, the United States has been gripped by the Great Depression. In addition to the massive economic woes plaguing America from this never-ending crisis, the Great Depression has given energy to both Long and Reed as they campaign against one another and the establishment."

USA_black_monday_desc:0 "The Great Depression which has been gripping America for over a decade looked to be slowly recovering under the Hoover administration, though nowhere near fast enough.

USA_political_crisis:0 "Political Crisis"
USA_political_crisis_desc:0 "The United States is in crisis. The Great Depression, which has been ravaging our nation for over a decade, has still not let up. Popular desperation has allowed the far-left Socialist Party of America and the far-right America First Party to gain strength in recent years. Others look to MacArthur and the Army as a way to solve both the depression and radicalization. Many worry that the United States could descend into civil war should our current situation not soon be resolved, or a radical presidential candidate win in the upcoming 1936 Elections."

USA_expand_the_USAAC_desc:0 "The United States Air Army Corps, in service since 1926, has largely remained on the sidelines of military development. Despite receiving a meager budget, they've yet managed to innovate in many aspects and High Command barely sees any reason to reform. Provided High Command's disputes in the past few years with Airmen, it has been decided they'd be better off remaining as an integral part of the Army."

USA_modernize_cavalry_tactics_desc:0 "It was apparent from our observers in the Weltkrieg that new tactics and technologies are becoming vital in the battlefield.

McNair's expertise in the 1920s with the Examining boards seems to have not gone to waste, and he has proposed an overhaul of the American Artillery production which he projects will lead to artillery pieces being easier to produce and repair, as well as more accurate on the battlefield."
USA_production_priority:0 "Production Prioritization"
USA_production_priority_desc:0 "As our War Industry hums along, McNair has stressed the necessity of the usage of both Anti Air and Anti Tank cannons to stop both armored and aerial threats dead in their tracks.

USA_CAS_model:0 "CAS Model Development"
USA_CAS_model_desc:0 "As the Air Corps never intended to be integrated into the army, hardly any development has gone into newer Close Air Support Models.

High Command will need to choose carefully who'll become our main Attack Bomber if we wish to succeed..."
USA_strategic_bomber_development:0 "Strategic Bomber Development"
USA_strategic_bomber_development_desc:0 "America hardly has any enemies within attack range to fear. As such, there has been a generalized thought that has been taking over the USAAF, spread by a group led by famous airmen like Carl Spaatz. The Army has dubbed them the 'Bomber Mafia' due to their methods, and this 'Bomber Mafia' is now requesting the funding to further expand on their long range strike plans."
USA_strategic_bombing_doctrine:0 "Strategic Bombing Doctrine"
USA_strategic_bombing_doctrine_desc:0 "The idea pushed by Spaatz and his acquaintances is a rather simple one: The Enemy won't be able to continue fighting if the home for which they are fighting for no longer exists. By destroying both their industry and their fighting spirit at the homefront, our troops will prevail both in morale and equipment on the front line."
USA_long_range_escorts:0 "Long Range Escorts"
USA_long_range_escorts_desc:0 "While having better bombers is vital to win the war of tomorrow at the enemy's doorstep, these bombers can seldom operate on their own.

Thankfully for us, our private contractors have come up with the NA-40, which could serve as a baseline to a new flexible bomber model, which the airmen insist on naming after Billy Mitchell despite High Command's protests. We shall fund these development efforts"
USA_Quesada_CAS:0 "Quesada's Close Air Support"

USA_engineer_corps_expansion:0 "Engineer Corps Expansion"
USA_engineer_corps_expansion_desc:0 "We are finally able to provide enough infrastructure and planning to provide Engineering Corps in the field.

ustates.1.t:0 "The United States in 1936"
ustates.1.d:0 "In 1936, the United States of America is gripped by unrelenting crisis. At first relieved it had managed to avoid the horrors of the Weltkrieg, Woodrow Wilson was the first US president to run and win a third-term as the “Man Who Kept the Peace” alongside his new running mate, former Attorney General Alexander Mitchell Palmer. Unfortunately, good feelings did not last long as Wilson suffered a stroke shortly after his election which set off a constitutional crises and left increasing power in the hands of Palmer until Wilson finally died in late 1923. Wilson, Palmer and the cabinet reacted to the French and British Revolutions and growth of American syndicalism with increasingly extreme crackdowns on union organizing and eventually a slew of organizations suspected to have connections to the radical left. As workers became radicalized in response and anarchist bombers made several attempts on Palmer’s life the political situation deteriorated alongside the economy due to a combination of strikes and a loss of trading partners. Wilson's intense Red Scare that associated racial equality and integration with socialism contributed to both the growth of the National Klan and increasing attention being taken away from the economy and towards combatting radicals. Palmer’s controversial presidency ended with the election of Herbert Hoover in 1928 whom attempted to calm the situation with a “Return to Normalcy” by re-legalizing many non-violent syndicalist outlets but this brief respite from chaos did not last as a cumulation of speculative investing sent the United States spiraling into the 1929 Great Panic and allowed the Berlin Stock Market to take its place at the forefront of the world economy.\n\nThe election of Herbert Hoover in 1928, while initially promising, failed entirely to reverse the decline of the American economy and the Great Panic has created of the worst financial crisis it had ever seen. This fueled the rise of radical politics in America from the far-left Socialist Party of America, the populist Share the Wealth Society under Huey Long and his national America First Party and the far-right Old Democratic Party, a far-right faction of the Democratic Party that places the blame of syndicalist and civil rights uprisings at the feet of immigrants, Republican cosmopolitism and liberal toleration of the left. Hoover's contentious re-election by means of the House of Representatives in 1932, and the ongoing Great Depression means that these problems are unlikely to be resolved any time soon. Many throughout the country fear the upheaval that would result should one of the extreme parties come to power, or should the Depression continue unabated."

ustates.2.d:0 "Despite the political turmoil and ineffectual economic relief programs, it seemed to many as if the economy of the United States might finally be undergoing a slow recovery after the Great Panic of 1929. Black Monday has put an end to such hopes, and has sounded the death-knell for an already ailing economy. Republicans and Democrats have both pledged to fix the economy should they win the election, though public confidence in them is rapidly waning. Reed, William H. Murray and Long finally seem to agree on something as they have all railed against the corrupt banking and political sectors, which they blame for allowing the crash to happen."

ustates.3.d:0 "The 1936 election is looking to be one of the most contentious in American history. Many politicians within the upper circle of the Republican and Democratic Parties fear that a victory by the Socialist Party of America, the America First Party or the Old Democrats would mean the end of America and the American way of life.\n\nIn order to avoid this, a plan has been proposed by the Republican Party, in which they will nominate a member of both the conservative and progressive wings of their party to their ticket to guarantee a moderate platform. As part of the agreement the Republicans will not run candidates in the “Solid South” to give traditional democrats a better chance and likewise will not run party-endorsed candidates in Progressive heavy areas. This plan is unlikely to be popular with lower ranking members of the parties, but it may be the only thing that can prevent the radical parties from gaining strength. MOst importantly, all parties agree that whichever party between the three of them wins a plurality of the vote for President will be endorsed by the other two parties for President in the House of Representatives. Despite his lack of public popuarity President Hoover is still head of the Republican Party his support would be invaluable to gaining support for the plan from more Senators."

Representing the parties moderate conservatives is Charles Curties, vice-President of the United States who is well-renowned for his negotiating abilities amongst politicians, giving him a moderate's appeal that crosses party lines. However, representing the more liberal wing of the party is famed businessman and Kansas Governor Alf Landon whom favors more direct economic intervention in the economy and could win over progressive Republicans whom recently defected to the left-leaning Progressive Party. While the loser will be the others vice-presidential candidate to show party solidarity Hoover using his little remaining political capital to back a candidate could make or break them."

Although the Republican Party and the Southern Democrats have long been mortal enemies many liberals nonetheless consider them a neccessary bulwark for a coalition in favor of liberal democracy when the election comes about.

Garner is a well-known anti-radical who won the nomination on the back of two promises: to preserve the economic progress made by Wilson and to preserve liberty at all costs. As Wilson remains controversial even within the party this raised a fair amount of debate and angered members of the party who felt Garner was too conservative and out-of-touch to be president. Nonetheless, he has much more support than not within what remains of a Democratic Party that is increasingly being absorbed by either the Old Democrats on its right-wing or the AFP and Progressives on its left. Garner's promise to preserve democracy without giving into any form of radicalism and denouncing those who would give extreme compromises to them is appealing to many fearful of America's increasing political unstability."

Saying the problems in the American political system was a symptom of unfair economic policies and lack of opportunity, Norris endorsed a massive project to reinvest in poor communities and work with union leaders to not only stabilize the country but "make it truly fair".

Today they declared their nominee for president to be their longtime de facto leader and Governor of Oklahoma William H. Murray who said that he's running a campaign against "Communists, Corporations and Miscegenation".

Those under the radical banner in their political enclaves have received some social welfare with Share Our Wealth donations from the AFP, International Red Aid from the SPA and the machine handouts and White League protections from the Old Democrats.

While the plan has obviously not been made public, we at least have it as a contingency if the radicals enact one of their revolutions from within the government.

Charles Curtis is infuriated but others in our cabinet clearly admire the MacArthur 'clique' and his ability to reasurre many establishment figures that he can restore order to the nation.

The most severe heat wave in the modern history of North America, 'The Great Heat Wave' started in late June and went up over 100°F (38°C) as drought conditions worsened due to a continued lack of rain. Now, in July, the heat has reached all-time records. In Steele, North Dakota, temperatures have reached 121°F (50°C). In Ohio, temperatures have reached 110°F (43°C), which was close to tying a record high set in 1934.\n\nThis comes in a time of major political unrest, with the America First Council a major force in Midwest Politics, and Socialist and Syndicalist forces gathering strength in the Great Lakes region. The drought is continuing, and over 3,000 reported deaths have been linked to it. Many people are suffering from heat stroke and heat exhaustion. Farmers across the continent saw their worst harvest on record, causing corn and wheat prices to skyrocket, and this heat wave does not seem to be giving up any time soon."

While many are expecting the so-called "Mainstream Parties" to back one another the Old Democrats are atteempting to court conservatives while the SPA demands progressives back them or be held responsible for a 'reactionary' victory.

While we could attempt to forestall this coup it's fairly obvious that MacArthur's wing of the military is preparing to accept the offer and may have instigated the entire arrangement.

Believing that the corrupt financial sector was primarily responsible for creating and prolonging the Depression, Reed has moved to nationalize the banks of Wall Street to force them to act in the public, rather than the private, good. This includes stopping banks from foreclosing on bankrupt homeowners. A filibuster by Senator Roosevelt has forced Reed to resort to an Executive Order, appealing yet again to national security.

To most of Reed's cabinet, it was clear that private mining companies would be entirely unable to balance the needs of the public with their greed, and moved to nationalize the drilling and mining companies, included Standard Oil, whose case against Executive Order 7089 was still pending.

It is clear that he intends to appoint 6 pro-socialist justices to the bench, which will ensure his Executive Orders will remain constitutional.

Also included with the executive order is a wide array of tax increases on the wealthiest Americans. While incredibly popular with the AFP's base, and hardly unexpected considering Long's 'Share the Wealth' slogan, many Americans are protesting what appears to be a massive overstep of the executive power of the president. The constitutionality of increasing taxes by fiat, and how this new agency would even manage to operate, are questions that has thrown the government into immediate chaos and confusion.

Huey Long also made sure to remind the people that, by all rights, he should be president and that he would have fixed this crisis already. The President, meanwhile, responded in a recent interview with newspapers that Long has a serious case of 'sour grapes', and political cartoons have begun depicting Long as a childish babboon - much to the AFP's outrage."

ustates.71.d:0 "Despite having a reputation of being a 'fighter' known for making outrageous and offensive statements in public, Old Democrat leader William H. Murray is very clearly more shrewd in private. He has unsurprisingly fought tooth and nail to keep Long and Reed from getting more power in their home regions but before they gave up on him he finally has an offer for everyone at the table. If the Socialists and AFP "pull out" from the Old Democrats regions and instead invite their most prominent supporters to live in their own regions, he will vote for increased autonomy. However, with this autonomy he wants Federal investigations into the White Leagues within the Mason-Dixie line reduced, calling this a 'local matter', and a public promise for the President to respect states rights. Finally, on top of all this, he wants a substantial investment into the rural South... by giving a large grant for Murray to do with as he sees fit. This would effectively ensure the Old Democrats rule from Indiana to Florida for the foreseeable future but it is the only hope for the Home Plan to work."

ustates.7100.t:0 "Radicals Upset!"
ustates.7100.d:0 "Reed and his entourage are upset that we have agreed to Murray's demands to give the Old Democrats greater control of his region, viewing it as a betrayal of the workers whom have supported him in the region. Long on the other hand seems willing to agree so long as there is a 'ceasefire' between the two, meaning that Long will not work to expand his influence among the Old Democrats but will keep those party machines which already exist and will 'suggest' (as he 'officially' has no control over them) the Minutemen cease aggressive acts between them. AFL leader Samuel Gompers has been called into a meeting between the President and Reed to delegate between the two and he came up with his own compromise. While the SPA will cease to encourage growth in the south they will be given even greater control of the North, a large grant to do what they wish with, protectionism shall stay the norm with the Entente and the federal Government will make no attempt to cease the so-called 'Combined Syndicates' from aiding the syndicalist movement in other parts of the world. Reed has reluctantly agreed believing it will aid more workers in the long-run and, of course, it is likely a fanatic such as he believes the Syndicalist Movement can liberate the American South once he can help it become the unipolar ideology of the world. The only question now is if the Republicans will agree. Of course Long has seen an opening to also demand that the AFP be compensated for going along with this deal with a larger grant which they can spend on their rural and unemployed supporters."

ustates.72.d:0 "With all sides finally agreeing to allow each other to have greater autonomy in each others regions and to cease attacks on another and the Federal Government there is the final issue of the militias each side have raised; The Old Democrat's White Leagues, The Socialist Parties Red Militants and the America First Parties Minutemen. It is unlikely that peace, democracy or respect for the Federal Government can last if these militias continue to grow. The Republican cabinet has requested that each faction cease funding militia recruitment outside their territory and that militias register with state governments and are therefor legally accountable and regulated. Others in Congress want them disarmed at once however, stating that it's the only way to ensure peace. While the faction leaders have agreed to the former so long as the others yank out of 'their' regions it is unlikely they would go with the latter, though MacArthur has suggested that if we blindsided them and disarmed the militias at once they would have to go with it. Few others are confident this plan would work."

ustates.73.d:0 "The Home Rule Act of 1937 has passed with the federal government agreeing to give far more autonomy to AFP, ODP and SPA states in terms of their economic and social policies in return for turning down their militia recruitment, ceasing their current strikes, rioting, party recruitment in other areas of the states and aggressive action against both us and each other amongst our other demands. The Socialists now currently transitioning Chicago and Detroit to semi-syndicalist systems where workers are universally unionized and own shares of production, the AFP have begun implementing a smaller and local variant of Share the Wealth and the ODP have implemented a combination of more "nativist" laws and anti-corporate policies in the American Southeast. While many within the cabinet do not like giving them control even to this degree this level of decentralization has defused each while allowing us to focus on the West and East where the federal government is still most influential while disarming them of being an outright threat on the national level while giving each major constituency what they want."

[USA.GETLeader] has attempted to reassure him that this is the only way to peace and that American values will be protected but MacArthur demands to be put in charge of the general staff to ensure this is the case. While [USA.GETLeader] does not care for a military official implicitly threatening a United States President for increased power he must reach a decision."

He has declared [USA.GETLeader] to be in league with Reed and Long, the government to have failed to represent Americans, and that America's very soul was in jeopardy. While government officials attempted to urge calm, Murray's words have struck a chord across the nation, especially the South, firing up ODP support and - as advisors had warned the President - undoing previous efforts to contain them. With Murray and the ODP raising hell, Long and Reed are both returning home to guide their respective parties, claiming they will only return when the ODP threat is contained."

With the perception that compromise attempts have failed while various extremists continued to garner power, [USA.GETLeader]'s own cabinet has lost its confidence that any resolution would be reached with the most recent outbreak of hostilities. With the cabinet's apparent co-operation and a military clique backing him, General Douglas MacArthur took charge of an emergency administration intended to 'preserve the country from extremist forces, before we are completely overrun'. Of course this has only confirmed to the various radicals and populists that the US government was beyond saving, although MacArthur's soldiers seem prepared to fight. While the government is attempting to reassure the American public that all is under control, most are looking on in shock. Civil war appears imminent. The question remains of what the President himself should do?"

Some such as Norman Thomas has urged the AFL and IWW strikers to resist without violence but this hasn't always worked - especially when the strikers are simultaneously provoked by Old Democrat and Federalist supporters. Reed has publicly condemned the government for adding to the violence, rather than protecting those who need it most. 'What these workers need are jobs that don't exploit them, that don't sacrifice their flesh and blood upon the altar of American Greed," Reed declared in a Minneapolis speech. 'What they get instead is a government that acts at the behast of their capitalist overlords. Make no mistake that the Government's seemingly inaction is in fact action, the action of the ruling class acting with full awareness of defending of their class power.'"

ustates.80.d:0 "The SPA strikers aren't the only ones feeling the heat at the hands of American police. So, too, have the White Leagues come under increased scrutiny. Several Minutemen training centers in Alabama and South Carolina were raided by police in recent days, and Old Democrat meetings have been constantly harrassed - or so Klan Leader Hiram Wesley Evans has loudly complained. 'The federal government has opted for open tyranny,' he said. 'They will do anything to keep us down, when what we seek is a government that is worthy of us!'

ustates.83.d:0 "National Guard units today fought with Minutemen militia in northern Louisiana, a raid that soon turned into a bloodbath as Minutemen opened fire.

Huey Long and the AFP denied involvement with the militia, but questioned the presence of the National Guard in what should clearly have been a police matter. The militia, they claim, were merely defending themselves. Photos of the ensuing bloody scene have circulated in southern newspapers, resulting in a new wave of outrage from the public directed at the federal government."

Guardsmen fired into the crowd leaving five dead. It did not take long for this to quickly be dubbed the 'Pittsburgh Massacre' and the Steel Belt was driven into a frenzy. Soon National Guardsmen and police were fighting with SPA militia throughout the region.

ustates.84.a:0 "What next?"

ustates.85.t:0 "March on Detriot"
ustates.85.d:0 "The Old Democrats, America First Party, Socialist Party of America and National Guard have once again come into conflict in Illinois when Old Democrats sought to take the Socialists to task for causing yet another strike that is exasperrating the economy. Old Democrat leaders blamed the weakness of the government in not finishing off "revolutionary leftists" and opposing the efforts of the Old Democrats to complete the goals of Woodrow Wilson and Arnold Palmer in finishing off the radicals and that the distant Federal Government bureaucrats was instead sympathetic to them and the AFP's "false egalitarianism". The official Old Democrat newsletter went on to blame the AFP and  for encouraging political corruption and the growth of the bureaucratic state while denouncing minorities in the government and which both the AFP and Socialist Party collaborate with. They ended by saying that they were organizing a march on Chicago to protest socialist behavior."
ustates.85.a:0 "That's not good"

ustates.86.t:0 "Counter Protest Organized!"

In response Huey Long, whom no doubt did not care for Murray's insults against him and Reed being in the spotlight, announced that Minutemen would be present to show Americans that true Americanism is still present in these dark times and to protect American citizens from the Old Democrats and Socialists. While all sides have been criticized for their behavior and possible motives there is little doubt this will end badly."
ustates.86.a:0 "We will do what we can"

ustates.87.t:0 "Detriot Bloodbath"
ustates.87.d:0 "The March ended nearly as quickly as it began and, as expected, was a disaster. The SPA and Old Democrats are blaming one another for firing the first shot and it is uncertain which of the two started the outright fighting but regardless the Federal Government, Minutemen, Socialists and Old Democrats began fighting amongst each other once the rioting broke out between them and few could tell one another from each other. Eventually however it became clear that the SPA had too many supporters in the area and the other factions had to retreat. The country is quickly breaking down as the bodycount is well over 200 and the Federal Governments weakness has been utterly exposed and no side can rely on them to keep order against the others. On top of this the National Guard is being blamed in the papers for civilian deaths alongside the other factions, depending on which parties newsletter is doing the printing."
ustates.87.a:0 "Now what?"

ustates.88.t:0 "Compromise Fails!"
ustates.88.d:0 "It appears we were too cocky. While our first few raids on militia headquarters went off without a hitch we failed when attempting to arrest a group of Minutemen in Southern Missouri, resulting in a shootout that kill 34 men, 12 national guardmen and 22 minutemen. The ODP and SPA militants became even more paranoid we were planning to actually wipe them all out and have likewise fired back at our boys. Willam H. Murray, Jack Reed and Huey Long can now finally agree on one thing; that we are not to be trusted. They have fled home to doubtlessly prepare a counter-attack before habeus corpus is likely suspended."

Garner was quoted as saying 'We are in a tough-minded recognition that the fight for a better America is a long one.' On the economy, Garner has promised reform through personal sacrifice and austerity, as was done after the Panic of 1893.

He has ordered all rioters in the Steel Belt to return home and likewise for all AFP minutemen and ODP militants to stand down before military action is taken. All SPA, AFP and ODP Senators walked out of Capitol Hill, to the jeers of their Republican and Democratic colleagues, thus adding to the sense that the country was nearing a political breaking point."

ustates.9101.d:0 "J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the FBI, arrived at the White House early today to grimly inform President [USA.GetLeader] that civil war is imminent. The best chance for the federal government, he says, is to take decisive action now before the AFP and SPA can become more organized. An assassination of Huey Long would mean the collapse of the AFP, as it centered around his personality. An assassination of Jack Reed, meanwhile, would throw the SPA into disarray while the IWW and AFL competed for leadership... at least long enough for the immediate danger to pass. There would be consequences, Hoover advises, not least of all the rightful suspicion that would fall on a democratic government for taking such an extreme act... but these are desperate times. If the FBI is to act, Hoover says, they must act now, for there is only time for one operation."

ustates.9103.t:0 "Military Action Prepared!"
ustates.9103.d:0 "Our military is prepared to defend the Republic from the radicals! The only question now is where to use it? Anti-radicals have suggested using the bulk of the military to occupy the syndicalist occupied territory that is still striking while the cabinet would like to spread out the forces more and occupy all three radical factions. George Marshall however would like to split the difference, placing most of our military in the Steel Belt while using counter-espionage in other territories to prevent an immediate revolt, though he warns this will only buy time as they are likely already announcing a revolt against the President's hardline and out of fear that Garner will come after them once the SPA is finished."

However while the Red Militias have weakened and the government has gained legitimacy in the eyes of the citizens of the Steel Belt the workers have not yet been won over to our side, with many still refusing to work even if they are not outright SPA members. Hardliners such as Alvin M. Owlsey and Harry F. Byrd have been encouraged by our recent success and are pushing for us to finish the job by cracking down on the rest of the strikers and unions so that industry may hire new workers or they learn not to engage in such behavior. However Vice President Al Smith and other cabinet members are pushing for us to cut a deal with industry leaders to raise wages in return for protection from the militias noting that most of these workers are not natural militants if they were treated fairly and SPA support can be undercut in the process."

MacArthur is furious at the situation feeling victory could have been attained if the government hadn't fumbled the situation and the radicals will soon be on our doorstep due to Garner and his adivsors.

While it is unclear why Hoover kept this information to himself unless he was hedging his bets to use this information as a bargaining chip in case of an Old Democrat or non-establishment victory is unclear but despite Norris' disgust with Hoover for not pursuing this earlier it is obvious publishing this and bringing Stephenson to court could discredit the Klan."

Garner's speech to the Senate spoke of the sacrifice needed if America is to recover from the Great Depression and attempted to boost market confidence by stating that the cut was partially due to the belief of his cabinet that the Depression was already coming to an end, and it was met with mostly skepticism and jeers from radical Senators. Even Garner's own cabinet expressed reservations regarding his choice, suggesting passage of the bill might prove difficult... though, if it can be managed, it would almost certainly save the country by reinvigorating private investor confidence in the nation."

ustates.93.t:0 "Long Denounces Austerity Measures"
ustates.93.d:0 "As discussions began in Capitol Hill regarding the austerity bill, the AFP immediately denounced it.

Austerity, he claims, would leave the average American more desperately poor than they are now, and would leave them vulnerable to syndicalist and reactionary rhetoric. Long said he would be directing the AFP to oppose the bill at every turn, for the sake of the country."

While the bill is solidly backed by Democratic Senators, it is rabidly opposed by both the SPA and AFP... and while there are enough Republican and ODP Senators remaining on the fence, passage may prove unlikely without intervention. It is possible that President Garner could campaign for the votes of influential Republicans and hope that enough Old Democrats break party line to vote for the bill.

ustates.100.t:0 "Third Parties Stumble"
ustates.100.d:0 "With the Democratic Party reabsorbing much of their old constiuencies among the Old Democrats, Southern AFP and even part of the Steel Belt that is becoming connected to the Democratic-party based unions and political machines the third parties that once challanged the Democrats and Republicans at the national level have become state-level parties instead, with Long's AFP being the most succesful but becoming relegated to running Louisiana and some assorted populist districts, his influence in Congress remaining only due to his willingness to work with progressives. However, the Progressives are increasingly being reabsorbed by the Republicans with George Norris, Hiram Johnson, and others returning to the Republican fold. Meanwhile the Old Democrats and White Leagues are still present in the American Southeast but most are more or less either rejoining the Democrats or becoming relegated to the fringe elsewhere. SPA no longer commands the power it once did with its revolutionary tendencies being discredited and it's unlikely they will hold any seat higher than the House of Representatives for long. It seems the stability of the two-party system has been preserved at the national level and the radicals have been displaced."

Douglas MacArthur marched into Washington D.C today, having declared Garner an 'ineffective president whose weakness has endangered America'. MacArthur's marchers reminded many in D.C. of Cox's Army of 1932, except these men are motivated to preserve the country from extremist forces. Garner's own cabinet has assured the public that this action is necessary, and have been working with MacArthur to install an emergency government from the White House - even as the majority of America looks on in shock. Civil war is imminent. Garner himself is forced to choose between fleeing the nation or accepting his new role as a President-in-name only."

Garner was fortunate that with the sudden downfall of D.C. Stephenson the ODP's party discipline has weakened to the point that ODP congressmen such as Philip H.

### Norris route ###

ustates.106.t:0 "Norris Proposes Intervention"
ustates.106.d:0 "In response to the ongoing crisis, President Norris has proposed a bill to begin a series of economic intervention policies. The bill will create an insurance for bank deposits in treasury-approved banks that will not engage in risky investing. The bill also allows the federal government to create a comission to monitor stock market exchanges against fraud. The Progressives believe this will restore confidence in the market, creating jobs from one end of the country to the other. Both the SPA and the AFP have declared support for the bill despite believing it does not go far enough and believing it may be too friendly to the very businesses that caused the depression in the first place. The ODP meanwhile claim this is just another way for federal liberals to empower wealthy cosmopolitans and progressives in D.C. at the expense of Americans, calling for banks to be broken up and handed to native citizens on the state level. We may have to modify the bill to get more of the AFP and SPA on board, of which Quentin Roosevelt has proposed to retroactively investigate those who may have commited fraud and charge them to show we are the not the same people as the corrupt elements of the business community who caused this crash as well as our committment to justice."

While Long is more open to working with Norris he has made it clear that he wants for the AFP strongholds and its allies to have immediate access to rural aid, with the AFP receiving credit for the relief. Reed on the other hand had more radical demands, demanding support for workers coops, urban spending, the release of a laundry list of SPA activists who were arrested for various relatively petty crimes and government protection of unions. He went on to state the SPA should be given greater leniancy over the region, at which point Long demanded the same for the AFP and that he would like to be involved in passing the relief bill."

ustates.110.d:0 "Oklahoma Senator and ODP Leader William H. Murray has denounced the President as betraying the foundation of America by bringing two radicals and race traitors into the White House to conspire against the good Christian men and women of the nation. Using words that newspapers opted not to reprint in full, jeers came from the ODP wing of Congress as Thedore Bilbo cried out 'God Bless Alfalfa!' Other members of Congress denounced the speech however and afterwards William Borah of Idaho accused Murray of attempting to incite civil disobedience."
ustates.110.a:0 "Damn him"

ustates.111.t:0 "General Strike Spreads"
ustates.111.d:0 "The SPA's general strike has spread far and wide, after a call by Jack Reed to demonstrate against the latest bout of government inaction, all but bringing the nation to a standstill in many industrial states. The city of St. Louis in particular has become a warzone, day to day life all but ended as strikers clash variously either with Federal forces, the ODP militants or even with AFP Minutemen. The sense of chaos has led to several riots as protests by regular citizens have turned into looting and civil unrest. People are leaving St. Louis by the thousands, calling for immediate government intervention. All paramilitaries involved have begun organizing their respective forces and contacting governors and other politicians in their camp. Another Civil War appears to be coming to America."

ustates.112.t:0 "Relief Bill Passes"
ustates.112.d:0 "The Long-Reed Bill (originally the Reed-Long Bill before Long insisted on a change) has passed congress! However, the ODP is refusing to accept the aid claiming that its a ploy to increase the power of hostile entities over their people, citing the bill increasing the power and funding of the SPA and AFP, and announced they would not allow AFP strongholds within their territory to receive "aid from a criminal government". They insist that they be allowed to handle all relief funds in their area or retribution is inevitable, with Senator Ellison D. "Cotton Ed" Smith promising "a Great Reckoning". On a brighter note the SPA has called off the general strike for the moment."

ustates.113.t:0 "ODP Infuriated"
ustates.113.d:0 "The ODP is unsurprisingly demanding that we reverse our decision to send troops to the White League occupied American Southeast alongside various other areas of the nation. Murray has called it 'DC tyranny' amongst other things while John E. Rankin shouted every slur he could seeminly think of in response to the occupation of Mississippi. They are currently stalling as much as possible in Congress and the National Democratic White League under Joseph Simmons has printed newsletters decrying us. While some want us to pull back at once Douglas MacArthur has demanded we stay and finish the job, and that the SPA and AFP must show their loyality to America by having their militias work with federal military officers to support controlling the border regions of the ODP strongholds."

ustates.1131.d:0 "A small unit of our men sent to keep the peace in South Carolina have been ambushed while walking the streets of Raleigh, with several White Leaguers opening fire on them and raining firebombs on them. The act was applauded by the notably extreme South Carolina governor Coleman Blease, an affiliate of the so-called "Old Klan" who has stated that South Carolia will not stand for a "Second Reconstruction" and that retribution is inevitable. Arresting him is likely to incite a revolt but some progressives are pressing us to do so. For what his opinion is worth, MacArthur believes that it would be dangerous to arrest the governor and that it would put his men at further risk."

Our attempts to relieve the economy through direct spending effort has born debt just as it has fruit, and will likely take while to pay down. At the very least, we likely can not safetly focus on such a task until our current projects are finished at this point. Nonetheless Democratic politicians such as Al Smith and John Nance Garner are demanding we reign in our spending or they will being blocking spending projects. However we are simply too tied to our new progressive alliance to do such a thing."

ustates.114.d:0 "Our occupation of the South has not been easy, with the Old Democrats resisting us and the National Klan denouncing us as traitors. Nonetheless while occupation has prevented an outright uprising it is clear that without the Klan losing support through other means we can not finish the job or hold on forever. Today however J. Edgar Hoover has alerted us that he has evidence of Indiana Klan Leader D.C. Stephenson's corruption, which includes him and his circle engaging in alcohol, drugs, intimidation, 'relations' with minors, sexual assault, and murder. While it is clear Hoover is interested in being rewarded for this find with increased FBI presence it is nonetheless neccessary to play along as publishing this and bringing Stephenson to court could discredit the Klan."

ustates.115.a:0 "Simmons grilled by Congress"
ustates.115.d:0 "William Joseph Simmons was questioned about his connections to the terrorist attacks committed by the NDWL during the occuption alongside Hiram Wesley Evans. Without the political clout they once had to protect them for inquiry it quickly became obvious that Simmons implausble stories of knowing nothing of the groups committing the acts could no longer be hidden from public eye. Both Simmons and Evans will likely stand trial soon. Meanwhile NDWL numbers are collapsing since the Stephenson scandal, with this recent action only accelerating its collapse. In Congress some ODP members such as Edward E. Cox and Carl Vinson are even crossing the floor and rejoining the Democratic Party, weakening the ODP as a politcal force"

ustates.1150.b:0 "Initially arrested by the FBI for his murders and other personal crimes, charges of conspiring attacks against civilians or at best knowing of them before they happened as likewise been added to his charges. The Indiana Klan is in shambles as Governor Edward Jackson, a near certain former Klan member himself, are attempting to distance themselves from the Klan. Stephenson however has requested that we take the death penalty off the table, in return for giving up the names of prominent Klan members and testifying against their activities. While this would aid in our fight, many would prefer to see him brought to justice and a deal cut with someone else."

Some think that we should promote more liberal and anti-syndicalist unions to be a ward against the influence of Syndicalism in politics. A few loyalists within the AFL and the defunct Knights of Labor are willing to cooperate with Congress in creating a national labor relations board. This board would be able to isolate IWW-affiliated unions, and give collective bargaining rights to unions that do not wish to see us hang. Others however, regard all trade unions as traitors to the country and should be outlawed toggether. Congress has decided to...?"

This has led to the firing of over 5,000 federal employees who were accused of being homosexual. The press have mostly approved of this measure, although a few tabloids claim we are preaching hypocracy. One of the chief prosecutors, FBI Director J.

It is claimed by the supporters that doing this will help prevent another crisis like the 1936 crisis from happening again.

Ten years ago the place where we are gathered was a sparse, forbidding desert. In the bottom of a gloomy canyon, whose precipitous walls rose to a height of more than a thousand feet, flowed a turbulent, dangerous river. The mountains on either side of the canyon were difficult of access with neither road nor trail, and their rocks were protected by neither trees nor grass from the blazing heat of the sun. The site of Boulder City was a cactus-covered waste. The transformation wrought here in these years is a twentieth-century marvel.'

The Corvée system is a tax imposed to pay for prisoners to repair public works. President Barkley spoke out against this idea, as his time in Kentucky taught him that penal labour will never surpass contract labour.

ustates.301.d:0 "The aftermath of the Second Civil War has given us time to assess not only the holes in our military capabilities, but potential improvements as well. Our General Staff has determined that we can outpace conventional engine based aeroplanes with the new fuel and thrust tech developed by Lawrence Bell. At the same time, we have procured enough engineers and scientists for Neddermeyer's idea for a plutonium gun nuclear weapon."

ustates.302.a:0 "Prepared for even Interplanetary War."

ustates.303.t:0 "Winchester Project"
ustates.303.d:0 "The project ran into a significant problem when it was discovered that the nuclear material Plutonium has a fission rate too fast for a bullet. The solution came in the form of depleted Uranium initially planned for a different nuclear project. This makes the weapon barely ethical under normal nuclear waste usage guidelines, and creates the issue of intentional biological damage from radiation on the target. Nonetheless, the Thin Man is a success"
ustates.303.a:0 "We are safe from Oppenheimer's deadly toy."

ustates.304.t:0 "The War and Peace Studies"
ustates.304.d:0 "In the past, our diplomatic conduct has been at the whim of ambassadors, many of whom had bought their positions from the party. The world we live in is too dangerous to afford such flippant choices to be made by agents of America, it is General MacArthur's opinion that a new approach to foreign policy is necessary, one that derives consensus from a group of trusted experts. This is what inspired the War and Peace Studies, a calling for only the brightest to represent America in this brave new world. This entity, the so-called the Council on Foreign Relations, will advise General MacArthur on how to suppress radical forces from any corner of the world."
ustates.304.a:0 "Constrained by diplomats no more."

ustates.305.t:0 "The White House and Xanadu"
ustates.305.d:0 "A surprising amount of support came from the pages of the many Hearst Newspapers that dot America. These papers drew up the image of MacArthur as the heroic Cincinnatus, hearing the call to save the Republic from certain destruction. A beacon for MacArthur's allies and the creation of an almost mythical personage through films and newspaper cartoons, Hearst has served as a stabilizing factor to the ship of the state. Even Hearst's attacks on radical unions and populists seemed to echo the words of MacArthur's radio speeches."
ustates.305.a:0 "We appreciate your support."

ustates.306.t:0 "The New Normal in America"
ustates.306.d:0 "When General MacArthur announced that he would not step down as leader those years ago, it was under the pretence of emergency. At the time. hundreds of thousands of Americas were unaccounted for, radicals prowled the countryside funding their politics with looted money, and the democratic pillar was unready to hold up the state. These past few years have seen a great many galvanize into hardy MacArthurites, and a new flavour of politician has emerged in the House of Representatives. These Congressmen see the need for an integral military role to check and nurture the business environment and ensure the rights of citizens cannot be infringed due to gridlock."
ustates.306.a:0 "Endorse the new supporters."
ustates.306.b:0 "Refuse this congressional oeuvre."

ustates.307.t:0 "Into the Wild Blue Yonder"
ustates.307.d:0 "While the United States has an air force, the capability to defend the skies and project power, we do not have an Air Force. The role is split between the US Army in service of our Paratroopers, and the US Navy aboard our Aircraft Carriers. The contention the General Staff addresses today is the ultimate fate of the Air Force, and to which branch should tradition take after. Those in favour of the Army contend that future operations will most likely be in ground support or air drops, while Navy advocates claim that Aircraft are essential to the future of Naval Warfare in engagements large and small. We must choose a side."
ustates.307.a:0 "The Air Force belongs to the Army."
ustates.307.b:0 "The Air Force belongs to the Navy."
ustates.307.c:0 "The Air Force Belongs to itself."

ustates.308.t:0 "Super-weapons on a budget"
ustates.308.d:0 "In the last few years, our military research has focused on the potential for internal conflict, narrowing our focus and budget for longer-term projects. This years' Congressional Budget has fortunately found some money to allocate to a long-term project. Three plans are presented to the military high command to meet and exceed the military projects of our rivals. The first is a rocket by Goddard theoretically capable of delivering explosives from miles away without risking pilot lives. The second is Oppenheimer's planned theoretical bomb using radioactive heavy metals as researched in Austria and Germany. The third is a much cheaper plan as proposed by the eccentric Wilhelm Reich, he claims that a bomb can be made much cheaper using his own personal physics research. On our part, we don't know much about what Wilhelm Reich is talking about, but his reputation in Austria gives us some comfort into whatever science he's using."
ustates.308.a:0 "Goddard's Rocket."

ustates.309.t:0 "Goddard's Successful Launch"
ustates.309.d:0 "At home again in Roswell, New Mexico, Goddard again goes to launch test rockets. The last time he was here, the rockets were smaller than his thigh, and reached only a thousand feet in height. Now the rockets soar miles over the desert and touch down with their dummy weights. Goddard's refusal to detonate explosive rockets on the Continental United States prevent the full scale of the damage to be known."
ustates.309.a:0 "Good boy Goddard."

ustates.310.t:0 "Oppenheimer's Bomb a Success"
ustates.310.d:0 "An invitation by Oppenheimer was sent out to nuclear researchers, physicists, and engineers throughout Europe. The promise of escaping persecution in Europe has resounded most strongly to Jewish scientists, some of whom emigrated to the US for the project. After a year and a half of experimentation and some cooperation with colleagues in Europe, a working atomic bomb is ready to be tested. The skies of Alamogordo New Mexico lit up in a flash of destruction as the test bomb Valediction exploded. Oppenheimer later said that the bomb was named after his favourite John Donne poem."
ustates.310.a:0 "The breath goes now."

ustates.311.t:0 "Reich's Failed Explosion"
ustates.311.d:0 "After many delays and several attempts to obfuscate the general staff, Wilhelm Reich's bomb project is discontinued and millions of dollars wasted on bunk. This became apparent to Reich's observers when tests showing his energy, named Orgone, could induce exothermic reactions that only he and his associates could see. The bomb itself being a hollow shell with layers of metals covering that never did explode, save for its collapse when Reich attempted to destroy it during the investigation. This embarrassment is currently making its rounds in the papers."

ustates.500.t:0 "Garner-Wagner Bill Re-Introduced"
ustates.500.d:0 "With assurances made by President Hoover that, unlike in 1932, this time he will not veto the bill, Democratic Senator Robert Wagner and Speaker of the House John Nance Garner have re-introduced their unemployment relief legislation package. Many in Congress feel that the package does not go nearly far enough, while others wonder how America - in the midst of a massive economic crisis - will possibly ever pay for it. The presence of Senators from the AFP and the SPA also complicates things immensely. Even with Hoover's pledge, it's unknown if Garner-Wagner has a real chance of passing."
ustates.500.a:0 "We shall see"

ustates.501.t:0 "Long and Reed Demand Changes"
ustates.501.d:0 "As expected, the early challenges to the Garner-Wagner Bill have come from the AFP and the SPA. Huey Long and his AFP Senators have demanded a vast increase in the social security provisions the bill provides, provisions most other Senators say America could never afford. Jack Reed and the SPA, meanwhile, say the bill doesn't do enough to protect the average worker, particularly from exploitation by struggling corporations. Both parties have attracted a lot of media attention, adding to the general sense of disorder and tension in Congress."
ustates.501.a:0 "Interesting"

ustates.502.t:0 "Senators Break Ranks"
ustates.502.d:0 "After weeks of negotiations, a number of establishment Senators have broken ranks over the coming vote on the Garner-Wagner Bill - most notably Robert Wagner, one of the bill's proposers, who says he will not vote for the bill unless protections for federal unemployment insurance are re-added. Many other Democrat and Republican Senators are concerned about the influence of the AFP and the SPA, and claim they will not vote for the bill if *any* concessions are made to either group... though others say that not courting either the AFP or SPA will make passage difficult if not impossible. President Hoover will need to intervene in order to save the bill."

ustates.503.t:0 "Long and Reed Furious"
ustates.503.d:0 "Both Huey Long's AFP and Jack Reed's SPA have reacted with fury at President Hoover's endorsement of establishment Senators. They have vowed to sink the Garner-Wagner Bill, claiming that the public is being deceived by a 'corrupt government which refuses to recognize the reality of America'. While the parties have both gained a considerable boost in support from their base, Democratic and Republican fortunes have improved somewhat, and there is a feeling that both have a better chance going into the next election... provided the bill actually passes."
ustates.503.a:0 "Let's hope it does!"

ustates.504.t:0 "Compromise with the AFP"
ustates.504.d:0 "Recent days have resulted in a compromise between many establishment Senators and the America First Party, with numerous extra provisions included for farm relief and unemployment protection - though nowhere near as far as the AFP originally demanded. Even so, Huey Long has declared this as a victory and is riding high in recent polls. Both Jack Reed's SPA and a large number of Republican Senators have declared this a betrayal of the American public, however, and have vowed to sink the Garner-Wagner bill when the vote comes."

ustates.507.d:0 "Though the vote was incredibly close, the Garner-Wagner bill has passed Congress.

ustates.508.t:0 "The Garner-Wagner Bill Fails!"

Both are of high importance, New York for its industry and Texas for its oil, and both are at high risk to takeover.

Though the old United Kingdom was on its way to repayment, there was a tacit agreement after the British Revolution that the debts wouldn't continue to be repaid until the Home Islands were recaptured.

Many in the United States consider MacArthur a hero, however, so when news was revealed of his arrest, angry demonstrations were just as prevalent as celebrations at the Pacific government's agreement to rejoin.

ustates.600.d:0 "The defence of the United States has always been an uphill battle. Stretched thin against the vast breadth of the North American continent, the United States Army has had little chance to distinguish itself throughout its 160 year history. It won the bare minimum of victories to maintain American independence during the Revolution and the War of 1812. It performed admirably against a corrupt regime in the Mexican-American War but half of those forces would provide the seed for the fledgeling Confederate Army during the ensuing Civil War. More recently the Army performed barely adequately to subdue the heavily outgunned Spanish and struggled to suppress the half-starved Filipino Insurrection more than 30 years ago. Prevented from joining in the Weltkrieg on either side, it has suffered in both doctrine and technology, with no tanks at all and a small Air Corps subsidiary to the ground forces. With the hobbled lion that was the British Empire on the northern frontier and a syndicalist stronghold poised in the south, the U.S. Army must be asked to defend the Republic from enemies within and without, and few agree that they are up to the task."

ustates.601.d:0 "The United States Navy, long the darling child of the American defence establishment has been a strong force in global maritime affairs for nearly fifty years. A rival even to the vaunted Kaiserliche Marine and Royal Navy at their height in the Weltkrieg, it has defended America's shores and sallied forth to spread stability and democracy for nigh on 160 years. From John Paul Jones' raid on the British mainland to the Battle of Manila Bay, the Navy has provided the security needed by the republic from those that would infringe upon our independence from beyond the seas. All is not well in the modern day, however. The navy's ships are old, her flagships Weltkrieg-era dreadnoughts even as Germany and the Syndicalists engage in a new naval arms race, and the tattered remnants of the Royal Navy lick their wounds. New carriers have been commissioned, but they are nowhere near ready to take on the imperial Japanese fleet. The Marine Corps fares better, hardened as they are by constant action in tropical locals, but they are small, only a few regiments strong, and are powerless to affect increasing tension at home from their far-flung island bases. The honour guard in Washington D.C. look increasingly powerless as violence in the nation's capital increases. Our White ships might dominate the waves but many question whether it will be enough to face the gathering storm n the horizon."

Now not only is a reform plan to deal with the imminent crisis necessary, but also urgent as the rebellious states threaten the unity of America. Luckily for us, several staff members had already been advocating for reform plans since the early 1920s, and they have been summoned by High Command to a meeting for them to lay out their plans. After a session full of army formalities, 4-Star General Malin Craig presented a restructuring and mobilization plan which would focus on trying to arm as many men as possible while improving and enhancing the High Command to have an edge in planning over our enemies. While many conservative members applauded his traditionalist stance, Major General Adna R. Chaffee criticized his stance, quoting several instances in which planning and mass mobilization didn't earn the victory to the French in the Weltkrieg, and instead advocating for the adoption of the 'Thunderbolt': Fast moving armies supporting themselves on motorized and mechanized elements to quickly exploit enemy weak spots. While both sides got gridlocked into a discussion for radically different plans, Major General Leslie McNair offered an alternative solution: The American strength lies with its industry, and it is clear that in order to win, that strength should be exploited to its fullest. For that he proposes the restoration of the late 1920s and early 1930s artillery examination boards and the development of anti air and anti tank batteries to counter-act any enemy developments on this front.

Unfortunately, the Army High Command in many aspects refuses to acknowledge this, and as a result, spark conflict with many Air Branch generals who wish to direct the development of their own branch. With the country's integrity at stake, the High Command has decided to negotiate with the Air Force Generals, and the result of the negotiations is pretty clear: The Air Branch will not stand for a continuation of the Status Quo, and demands that at best, their force is given significant autonomy from the Army and reorganize as the United States Army Air Force, and at worse for the United States Army Air Corps to be expanded and supported to suit the needs of the battlefield.

After finishing a rigorous conditioning and training program started two weeks ago, a lottery was made to decide the jumping order of the experimental paradropping platoon made up of volunteers. When the Douglas C-33 took off from the Langley Air Field and finally was put into position to start the experiment, Second Lieutenant William T. Ryder became the first American Paratrooper after making his jump and landing near Fort Benning. The second man, however, refused to jump, and so the first enlisted man to become a paratrooper was Pvt. William N. "Red" King, and then the remaining 8 platoon members in the aircraft.

Soon enough, the 501st Parachute Battalion was formed, quickly followed by other battalions and regiments. After a week recruitment, the number of volunteers was enough to form 5 paratrooper divisions for us to utilize. While these divisions still lack combat experience, this breakthrough in Airborne tactics should not be underestimated, and the High Command is looking forward to seeing their investment in these divisions pay off."

While the Secretary has managed to calm the General down and reassure him that the army's role in the battlefield will always come first, word of the meeting has gone out and many Admirals, including MacArthur's bitter rival Admiral Hart, are already sending letters asking for MacArthur's resignation.

The document highlights the specific capabilities of tanks that makes them a unique threat on a modern battlefield characterized by open warfare, like the tank's speed and mobility which, when combined with the lack of a stabilized front, increased the need to ensure protection of flanks and rear areas against armored attacks.

Instead, tank, armored infantry, and armored field artillery battalions, as well as smaller units of tank destroyers, engineers, and mechanized cavalry have to be assigned as needed in order to accomplish any given mission. To achieve this, he wishes to split the armored division into the combat commands named "A" for the main force, "B" for flank defence, and "R" for reserve units. While his concept is clearly inspired in the German 'Kampfgruppe' concept, the High Command has received his idea with open arms and are starting to implement the new organization system across the board as well as distributing the new manual to the field officers."
ustates.613.a:0 "It seems that studying the Germans has paid off"

ustates.614.t:0 "Release of the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet"
ustates.614.d:0 "One of the major lessons from the civil war was the need to enhance the speed and clarity of our communications on the front line while not making our movements and organization system obvious to the enemy. In order to create a consistent naming system, the Army and Navy had designated a comission from the Signal Corps to work on a new radio alphabet system for our men to use, and we finally have the results from their efforts. With the publishing and distribution of the 'Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet' manual, our new alphabet shall utilize the codenames Able, Baker, Charlie, Dog, Easy, Fox, George, How, Item, Jig, King, Love, Mike, Nan, Oboe, Peter, Queen, Roger, Sugar, Tare, Uncle, Victor, William, X-ray, Yoke and Zebra. While similar radio systems have been developed for the Canadians and the Germans, the fact we have finally taken the task of standarizing it means we're finally catching up with the lessons we missed in the Weltkrieg"
ustates.614.a:0 "This will give us an Edge in Communications"

ustates.615.t:0 "Adoption of the M1 helmet"
ustates.615.d:0 "Ever since the Weltkrieg proved that helmets were vital to protect the infantry from flying fragments of exploded ordnance, the American Army has utilized the British Mk I helmet designed by John L. Brodie, which gave it its current nickname. While adopted, the US never saw a need to mass produce it, and instead continued to buy the model from the British in the cheap during their depression in the early 1920s. While these helmets were effective at the time, our experience in the civil war has proven that even the Brodie is no longer suitable for modern combat and, as such, a research team was created under Major Harold G. Sydenham to look for alternatives. The research team concluded that by removing the Brodie's brim, by adding side pieces and earpiece, and by incorporating the suspension system into a separate inner liner, the new helmet could provide a protection the Brodie could never afford. The original test item was known as the TS3, and it received a favorable report from the Infantry Board in the recent weeks. With the approval of the War Department, it will soon enter mass production to supply our rapidly growing army."
ustates.615.a:0 "Glad we finally got rid of the Brodies"

ustates.616.t:0 "The Victory Book Campaign"
ustates.616.d:0 "As thousands of new recruits flood into training camps across the country, community librarians have recognized an opportunity to lend their support to our government. Individual libraries sponsored book drives to donate to their local military bases. In the last few months, members of the American Library Association met to discuss a plan for a coordinated nationwide drive to supply the troops with free books. The ALA presented their idea to the United Service Organizations and The Red Cross, who have received their idea enthusiastically and begun setting up more than four hundred recreational clubs on the outskirts of military camps. The Red Cross wanted books to send to military hospitals, remote camps with no libraries, their overseas clubs, and prisoners of war. The two organizations decided to split the project's funding, while the ALA provided technical know-how and both began campaigning for government approval. While our military is reluctant of accepting donated books, there is a real need for entertainment for our soldiers in the field and Army high command decided to give its approval to the project."
ustates.616.a:0 "Let's hope our soldiers enjoy it"

ustates.617.t:0 "Cancellation of the Victory Book Campaign"
ustates.617.d:0 "While the Victory Book Campaign has managed to pave the way for institutions like the Council on Books in Wartime and the War Book Panel, the Campaign itself is beginning to draw a lot of criticism from the Army. The Campaign was unfortunately not well suited for combat units, as the bulky hardcovers were found to be unsuitable for use in the field and many of the books donated were deemed unfitting by the revision committees. From 10.827.097 books gathered in the last year, an unacceptably high percentage of these were unsuitable, with VBC staffers having discarded 5,052,858 books. While the idea is still in the air, the Army has decided to order the VBC to come to a close, but has begun plans with the CBW to create a new plan to entertain our soldiers."
ustates.617.a:0 "Something Ends, Something Begins"

ustates.618.t:0 "Creation of the Armed Services Editions"
ustates.618.d:0 "With the collaboration of the graphic artist H. Stanley Thompson and the publisher and CWB executive Malcolm Johnson, Army Chief Librarian Raymond Trautman proposed his idea of 'Armed Services Editions': mass-produced paperbacks selected by a panel of literary experts from among classics, bestsellers, humor books and poetry. With the support of the Navy Chief Librarian Isabel DuBois, the project managed to reach the Army High Command. While the proposal was sound, a clause in Trautmant's proposal sparked controversy in the High Command Meeting. As he stated that all books should be, in all circumstances, acceptable to both services, and that works with 'Statements or attitudes offensive to our Allies, any religious or racial group, or not in accord 'with the spirit of American democracy'' should be discarded. Regardless of the controversy that it caused, the Army and Navy high command have agreed to give the project the green light, with both branches offering their own printing presses and the funding to expand printing further if necessary."
ustates.618.a:0 "Let's hope this time the Books Last"

ustates.619.t:0 "Creation of a Sniper Program?"
ustates.619.d:0 "With the harsh lesssons in urban warfare we have been forced to learn, we've come to realize that our army is woefully unprepared to face a new danger of the battlefield: Enemy Snipers. While Snipers proved their usefulness during the Weltkrieg, the Army high command had never seen any reason to expand upon it as it was seen as a situational solution for the battlefields of Europe. However, fighting in the American mountains, cities and forests have proved not only that they were wrong, but we have paid the price dearly for it, as we lack the means to counter-act enemy sniper operations, let alone send off snipers of our own to eliminate High Value Targets. As such, a proposal has reached High Command to kickstart one similar to the Sniper training that Canadian put their snipers through in the weltkrieg."
ustates.619.a:0 "The Proposal Passes"
ustates.619.b:0 "The Proposal is Shut Down"

ustates.620.t:0 "Sniper Selection"
ustates.620.d:0 "With the first test group of snipers having left basic training, the question has been brought up. While the first test group was drawn from volunteers from all the US Army, there has been a significant performance difference between the Marine and Ranger volunteers compared to the regular army volunteers. As such, both branches are contesting for the funding of the War Department to continue the Sniper Program, and we can only pick one. Which branch shall we support?"

ustates.621.d:0 "With the outbreak of the civil war, the President has dispatched the creation via executive order of an office that functioned to assist the President in clearing information on immediate defence measures. With it, the Office for Emergency Management has been born to maintain liaison with national defence agencies and to coordinate the national defence program, as well as keep both the Army and Navy in direct contact with the President. However, the mess of agencies, offices and commissions we have generated in the last few decades continues to grow, and many agree that our government should start looking into ways of reducing the amount of offices and increase the efficiency of existing ones."
ustates.621.a:0 "For now, this will do"

ustates.622.t:0 "Creation of the United States Office of War Information"
ustates.622.d:0 "Due to a lack of a centralized government agency to work as a distributor of wartime information, civilian newspapers present news as they discover and interpret it, with different outlets overalapping their stories with slight variations and the public hardly knowing what is true and what is propaganda. As such, and with permission of both the War Department and the President, the Office of War Information has been created to work as a connection between the battlefront and civilian communities. While many independent news outlets have expressed their concerns over a centralized agency becoming the sole distributor of wartime information, most experts agree that this is a necessary move."
ustates.622.a:0 "They have nothing to fear, we shall spread only the truth!"

ustates.623.t:0 "Changing the USAAC Roundel?"
ustates.623.d:0 "With the outbreak of the American Civil War, the issue has been brought up that our air planes share the same air force patch as our enemies. While radio communication has allowed us so far to distinguish between friend and foe, reports of friendly fire and unexpected enemy attacks abound, and the Air Force officers have come with a proposal to change our roundel from the star symbol within a blue circle with a red dot in the middle to a different roundel so our anti air units may better differentiate our planes from the enemy's. What should we do?"
ustates.623.a:0 "Let the enemy change it! This roundel is ours"
ustates.623.b:0 "Change it"

ustates.624.t:0 "Authorize Fire Bombings?"
ustates.624.d:0 "With the success of strategic bombing during the Weltkrieg, a proposal from the USAAF has reached the High Command. In it, it describes how to utilize a percentage of the budget to create a separate group of bombs with a special chemical mixture that can start huge fires upon landing, with the idea of utilizing these bombs on American soil against our enemies. While this could yield great effects hindering our enemy's industrial capabilities, the ethical implications of utilizing such inhumane weapons of destruction has made many members of the staff restless on the subject, as these bombs might easily end up hitting civilians unintentionally. Should we approve this despite of the dangers?"
ustates.624.a:0 "Yes, they are all traitors!"
ustates.624.b:0 "No, they are Americans too!"

ustates.625.t:0 "The War Department Relocates to the Main Navy and Munitions Buildings"
ustates.625.d:0 "With the Department of State leaving almost no room for the War Department to grow near the White House, the Secretary of War has authorized the War Department to move to a different location, specifically an ammunition warehouse provided by the navy. However, the warehouse is still too small the hold the ever growing War Department, with a new wing having been ordered to be constructed to acommodate newly employed staff, and we estimate we will need a larger structure to consolidate the 24.000 workers in offices scattered among 17 separate sites, as well as a possible additional 10.000 or more new workers that we are planning to include soon as our nation falls into conflict into conflict."

ustates.626.d:0 "Under the High Command's orders, General McNair has compiled a report of all the major flaws our army possesses at the moment that we will need to solve if we wish to prevail against our enemies in the civil war. The major summary sent to the War Department lists the following issues:\n\n1. Obviously deficient training of small units and in minor tactics.\n2. Faulty employment of the infantry division and of its combat teams.\n3. Failure fully to appreciate the purpose of motor vehicles and exploit their capabilities.\n4. Inadequate reconnaissance and lack of contact between adjacent units.\n5. Inadequate support of infantry by division artillery.\n6. Faulty signal communications.\n7. Too passive employment of antitank guns.\n8. Improper employment of horse cavalry.\n9. Neglect of ammunition supply and evacuation of wounded.\n10. Unreal situations due to faulty umpiring.\n\nIn the same manner, other issues have been brought up by other officers in which they include shortages of qualified staff officers and commanders to fill all the staff roles and deficiencies in individual training that would delay the effectiveness of unit training."

ustates.627.t:0 "Construction of 'The Pentagon'"
ustates.627.d:0 "With the shortcomings of the Main Navy and Munitions Buildings, the search for a more fitting permanent office space for the War Department has been ongoing for months already. First the military turned to the head of the Army’s Construction Division, Brig. Gen. Brehon Burke Somervell. He, in turn, tasked the chief of the design section, Lt. Col. Hugh J. Casey, to come up with a building that would fit a five-sided parcel of land that had been hastily purchased just below Arlington National Cemetery on the Virginia side of the Potomac River, which would house all the War Department's components. Originally the building was meant to be placed in a location known as the Arlington Farms, where the road shape resembles a Pentagon, which has forced the architect team to adapt the design to said geographic space. Many in the Department, however are questioning if positioning the building between the cementery, which by all means is considered hallowed ground for every American, and the stunning view of Washington D.C. is really appropiate, and two new locations have been proposed for the construction. Unfortunately, the requests for the materials have already been designed to accomodate a pentagonal shape, so even if we were to change the building location, the building will still be made in that shape, but we still need to decide where should the Pentagon be."

ustates.628.t:0 "War Department Moves into the Pentagon"
ustates.628.d:0 "While the construction of the Pentagon is still ongoing, the War Department has decided to move to the incomplete building, so as to not have to share space with the Navy staff anymore. Even though the building isn't even yet complete, a new expansion of the now lovingly called 'Pentagon' has already been authorized, and of the 5 wings, the 3 remaining ones to be built shall have bigger offices to accomodate the War Department's staff."
ustates.628.a:0 "Let's hope this is the last Expansion"

ustates.629.t:0 "Pentagon is Finished"
ustates.629.d:0 "With the final wing finally finished, the War Department has finally found its own home and the building now sports a reinforced concrete structure, using 680,000 tons of sand dredged from the Potomac River and Indiana limestone for the building's façade. It occupies 28.7 acres (116,000 m2), and includes an additional 5.1 acres (21,000 m2) as a central courtyard, with the hallways being so large that messengers are being issued with roller skates and bikes to speed up messaging between offices."

#USA's Army General Descriptions by Drozdovite#
###############################################

USA_DOUGLAS_MACARTHUR_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W 26 January, 1880, in Little Rock, Arkansas, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Douglas 'Big Chief' MacArthur, born from a long family line of military men, graduated from West Point as an Engineer Corps second lieutenant in 1903 with the highest grade in the academy's history. In 1904, he was promoted to first lieutenant and travelled to the Philippines in order to help his father with the construction of their headquarters. Through his father's influence, MacArthur quickly became a military advisor to President Theodore Roosevelt until 1908, where he took command of an engineer company in Fort Leavenworth, reaching the rank of Captain in 1911. All these high profile postings allowed him to join the American General Staff in 1912, at the young age of 32. MacArthur took part in the occupation of Veracruz, learning Spanish in a matter of weeks and taking part in several small skirmishes with the rebels. He returned to America in 1919, when he was assigned as the Director of the United States' Military Academy at West Point. In 1922, he returned to the Philippines, this time to inspect the island's defence status, and having to intervene personally to end mutiny of Philippino scouts. With his promotion to Major General in 1925, his notoriety only grew and grew, being sent to the 1928 Olympic games in the Netherlands to head the American Olympic Committee. However, MacArthur was also forced to comply with orders he didn't agree with, like the court martial of Brigadier General Billy Mitchell, which MacArthur has called 'one of the most distasteful orders I ever received'. During the 'Bonus March', MacArthur was forced, under President Hoover's orders, to put down the 'Bonus Army' despite MacArthur's agreeing with the protestors' demands. He has since then become the highest ranking American Officer, although he has had a troubled relation with the government's executive branch.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Born from a family that fought in the Civil War, MacArthur is willing to do whatever is necessary to keep America as a united, great and free country."
USA_DWIGHT_EISENHOWER_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W October 14, 1890, in Denison, Texas, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Dwight David 'Ike' Eisenhower, a fan of military history since a young age, applied for both West Point and Annapolis in 1910, being accepted in the former after the highest ranking candidate failed the physical requirement in 1911. He graduated in 1915 along with Omar Bradley and was almost discharged due to a leg injury, but West Point's chief medical officer interceded with the War Department and obtained a commission for him. Eisenhower would be posted with the 19th Infantry Regiment in the Mexican Border and reached the rank of Captain in 1917. He was transferred to Fort Benning in late 1918, where he remained training with the Camp Polk Tank school until the 1919 Motor Transport Corps convoy. 'Ike' was promoted to Major in 1920. His interest in armored warfare only grew and grew, and quickly joined Patton's and Van Voorhis in their requests of increased funding for a mechanization program. In 1924, he was sent to Panama, where he served under General Fox Conner, who decided to tutor 'Ike' into philosophy, military history and military theory and was selected in 1925 for the Command and General Staff College, graduating first in a class of 245 officers. Conner would help 'Ike' to get into the War College, becoming one of the youngest students of the academy and receiving the praise of General Pershing himself. After his graduation, he was assigned to the Army War College, and then served as executive officer to Major General George Van Horn Moseley, Assistant Secretary of War, from 1929 to 1933. Since then he has served as chief military aide of General Douglas MacArthur, accompanying him to the Philippines, where he served as assistant military adviser to the Philippine government. Since then, he has become MacArthur's undisputed second in command, and while their personalities tend to clash often, many claim that their skills complement each other."
USA_OMAR_BRADLEY_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W February 12, 1893, in Clark, Missouri, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Omar Nelson 'Brad' Bradley signed up to join the United States Military Academy in 1911, where he finished second in the placements for the appointments. However, the winner couldn't accept the congressional appointment for the academy, so it was granted to Bradley. He graduated in 1915 and was commissioned as an infantry second lieutenant, and becoming a close friend of another graduate of the same class, Dwight D. Eisenhower. He was assigned to the 14th Infantry Regiment stationed in the Mexican border, reaching the rank of Captain in 1917 and being transferred to guard the copper mines in Butte, Montana, remaining in garrison duties for the rest of the decade. From 1920 to 1924, he worked as a math teacher in West Point, reaching the rank of Major in 1924 and undergoing the advanced infantry course at Fort Benning. Bradley later studied at the U.S. Army Command and General Staff School, graduating in 1929 and serving as an instructor in tactics at the U.S. Army Infantry School, where he met and established good relations with Lt.Col. George Marshall. He taught in West Point from 1929 to 1934, where he took a break to study at the U.S. Army War College, reaching the rank of lieutenant colonel. With the fears that the War Plan Blue might be executed in the near future, Bradley was first promoted to Brigadier General and then to Field Marshal along with Eisenhower by MacArthur's own request.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Largely considered one of the most dependable generals of the US Army, Marshall once described him as 'A quiet, unassuming and capable man, with sound common sense. He has an absolute dependability. Give him a job and forget it' and that reputation may have helped to speed up his promotion."
USA_GEORGE_MARSHALL_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W December 21, 1880, in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W George Catlett Marshall Jr. began his military career in the Virginia Military Institute in 1900, graduating in 1902 as a second lieutenant of the United States Army. Marshall was posted in the Philippines during the Philippine-American war, as well as helping to contain guerrilla operations in the area post-war. During the Weltkrieg, Marshall was sent to France, along with many other American officers as observers, where he was promoted to Captain for his observations. After working as aide-de-camp of General Pershing for a short time in 1919, he began being assigned to several positions in the army, mainly to relay his experience in the Weltkrieg to more inexperienced officers as well as helping the army modernize its doctrine. During this time, he became a key planner and writer in the War Department, commanded the 15th Regiment in the Legation Cities and taught the at the Army War College until 1927. Having being promoted to lieutenant colonel, he was appointed as assistant commandant of the Infantry School at Fort Benning, where he appointed Edwin F. Harding in charge of the school's publication. He'd be posted on different Infantry regiments until being promoted to colonel in 1933 and was promoted to his current rank of Brigadier General in late 1935 due to fear of desertion of several important members of the officer corps in case of 'internal instability'. Regardless, he is widely considered one of the best planners of the United States Army and is widely respected within the General Staff.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Born from a Democrat father and a Republican mother, Marshall has become a politically tolerant man, both publicly and privately."

While he wanted to join the Cavalry corps, his grades and overall performance in the academy caused him to be assigned to the 29th Infantry Regiment, stationed at the Philippines. In April 1911, he requested a transfer to the Signal Corps, where he completed his instruction as an aviator on May. He'd continue his pioneering work in the air force throughout the late 1910s, and became fascinated by the aircraft developments in the Weltkrieg. During the Twenties, he joined up his colleague William Lendrum Mitchell to fight for an independent air force, which lead to Mitchell being court-martialed. Arnold stood, along with other renowned airmen, in defence of Mitchell but failed to win the trial. Arnold would continue to fight for an independent air force, trying to sway congressmen and recruit pilots to his cause, until he was sent to Fort Riley for 'attempting to influence legislation in an improper manner', where he spent the next few years writing books trying to interest young people in the air force. He'd return in 1928 to enter the Army's Command and General Staff School, from where he graduated in 1929. He'd continue changing posts in the American army until 1935, where he was assigned with the General Headquarters Air Force, the closest thing to an independent Air Force he had been in all his career, being promoted to Brigadier General in March 2, 1935. With his requests of an independent air force largely refused, Arnold may harbour some resentment against the general staff..."

After returning to the US, he was assigned to the Artillery Batteries near the Mexican Border, where he was promoted to Major and assigned to the Inspector General's office in Washington D.C.. He remained in his post for the next few years, where his ability in French allowed him to translate many of the French reports on the battles of the Weltkrieg, earning him a promotion to Colonel in 1918 and later Brigadier General in 1920, and allowing him to meet the up-and-coming George C. Marshall in the War Department. He was then transferred to Fort Meade, where he was introduced to George S.
