COR_jim_crow_idea:0 "Jim Crow"
COR_jim_crow_idea_desc:0 "Named for a popular caricature of a stereotypical black slave that went on to become a pejorative for black Americans more generally, the Jim Crow Laws are an intense form of racial segregation with the goal of promoting white supremacy. Virtually all public facilities are segregated, interracial marriage is banned and black Americans are often used for cheap labor. This allows us access to cheap resource extraction, an easy means of empowering our supporters and the sympathy of hardline white supremacists throughout the nation. However, this comes at the cost of our widespread loathing among blacks, other minorities and non-white supremacists more generally which not only means they are loathe to join the military but that manpower has to be put forward to prevent rebellion. Furthermore, our economy's lowered pool of human capital and high reliance on simple labor-intensive resource extraction slows economic and technological advancement in most other areas."

There is no turning them down anymore for Alfalfa Bill is well aware of how the game is played but he remains aware he can get quite a bit from them ontop of being appointed the Hero of the Republic, being made governor of Oklahoma for life when the war is over and of course a more overt personal bribe. Bemused Murray rubbed his mustache having seen something along these lines occuring but nonetheless being entertained at his guests obvious desperation that he will accept to make the transition easier. He accepted on the condition that they also agree to both fund white relief and focus industrialization on the north which they could reassure him of by maintaining the current Old Democrat governors in the South and maintaing Patton as a general.

Meanwhile inside men for each major contender of the White League had clearly given away what happened as DC Stephenson entered the room wailing, wondering how the American Emperor could pass in his prime only to discover that Simmons was still breathing to his obvious surprise. While Stephenson was dismissing the staff Hiram Wesley Evans showed up to the scene after his driver had clearly raced to Simmons mansion and a tense standoff ensured as each wondered what to do. Finally they ordered the guards to carry Simmons to his bed and Evans went to contact his Klan connections in the south and military, during which DC Stephenson was left alone with the Emperor. Finally, the final contender for successor to the Leader of the Democratic White League generally walked in, namely Herbert W. Armstrong whom despite not officially being a Klansman was one of the most significant allies as a leader of the Christian Identity Elders of Zion burst into the room to see DC Stephenson staring hypnotically at Simmons Klan Ring and while the two argued Evans re-entered the room.

A right-wing vangaurdist group in the Rust Belt that broke off from the Klan to promote even more extreme violence, Effinger's position as a White League Leader gives him control over several Old Democrat votes in his region as well as being an important intelligence operator. In response Hiram Wesley Evans has asked James Colescott for an alliance to counter-act this while Herbert W. Armstrong has turned to Christian fundamnetalist Gerald B. Winrod by inviting him to be an Elder of Zion. The informal factions that have long been present but are finally boiling to the surface are now between Evans so-called Young Klan, Stephenson's Old Klan and finally Armstrong's Holy Church of Zion.

This intel could be of great value in such bloody times, especially as the area has such a fondness for syndicalism as would bringing the rabid Black Legion under greater control. Nonetheless he is well-aware of why this offer has truly come up in that DC Stephenson desires closer ties to the military via his ally Effinger and as such accepting would greatly empower Stephenson, something Hiram Evans has tried to frantically warn Patton about.

According to the driver (whom claimed to have merely exited the vehicle to relieve himself) a wounded Armstrong crawled out of the car and lived longed enough to frantically beg for mercy while offering them money before the men fired over fourty rounds into him at point blank range. DC Stephenson gave a speench over radio claiming that Armstrong had ordered the death of Evans and Evans men had retaliated, making sure to leave out the near-impossible time frame and circumstances of the latters demise.

This simply can not go on and the Old Democrats and military have demanded a peace meeting between the three. However our intelligence branch, the Republican Bureau of Investigation, has caught wind that Stephenson simply plans to kill the other two participants at the meeting and then claim the men were killed by syndicalists.

Meanwhile Stephenson himself was busy attempting to empty a Klan headquarters safe before flee theing area with his main bodyguard Earl Klinck.

Armstrong likewise decried a now shocked Stephenson as a 'pervert of the highest order.' Patton and his guards then entered the building and detained both Effinger and his Legion bodyguards alongside Stephenson as the other members of the Democratic White League decried them. A flusteered William Bell Riley (officially still the head of state of the Constiutional Republic) was rushed onto center stage to read aloud the charges against a now frantic Stephenson whom switched between denial and decrying every member in the room as being no better than him, calling Evans a 'killer' and Armstrong "a violent hypocrite". Patton banged the gavel the second Riley was done reading about two paragraphs and found him guilt, then having a wailing Stephenson dragged outside to the nearest tree and hung by four men holding the other side of the rope until he finally died. The question was now what to do with Effinger, with Evans demanding he be exeucted as well whereas Armstrong stated that he likely had nothing to do with it, making sure to ask for mercy within ear shot of Effinger. The military men and Old Democrats are well aware that this effectively means that only two men remain in the ring and that Patton will have to side with one of them."

This sounds not unappealing for Old Democrats whom have to live in constant paranoia of having to choose between supporting the White Leagues policies and living with a target on their back as a result or risk becoming an enemy to the League. Nonetheless the hardliners are fanatically opposed to this, giving Armstrong as opening despite some being uneasy with his heretical form of Christianity. He is attempting to make an alliance with the Knights of the White Kamelia and ultra-right Klan chapters and is now reaching out to William Bell Riley to order the arrest of Evans as a traitor to the Republic whom is selling out white civilization to the demonic forces of liberalization and modernism. Himself a fundamentalist increasingly influenced by Christian Identity William Bell Riley is sympathetic to his request but he is well aware his power is basically nominal and thus asks Patton for military backing if he were to issue such an order."

constate.21.d:0 "Failing to secure the backing of Riley has put many of Armstrong's would be allies at ill-ease while Evans influence continued to grow. But a ray of hope shone through for the increasingly paranoid Prophet whom was now ordering members members of his own congregation to keep an eye out for the 'false prophets' when he was called by the head of the Knights of the White Camelia, George Detherage, whom offered an alliance against Evan's so-called "compromise" policies... in return for a price. Armstrong was suspiscious of his demands to have the meeting during a 'hunting trip' and demanded he be allowed to bring his guards while Detherage brought none. While surprised Detherage agreed, putting the Apostle of Christ at ease whom still would not show his face until Detherage was within range of his men. Now well aware there was no reasonable way Detherage could have set him up without also dooming himself Armstrong was ecstatic while walking through a prarie chatting with his new ally whom might be able to get a man close enough to Evans to end his rival when suddenly, from the tree line, gunfire opened up on Armstrong, Detherage and the bodyguards. While it is uncertain whether or not the Prophet himself was already dead when the attackers fired a shotgun at his head from point blank range, it is known Detherage was almost certainly still alive when they hung him from a nearby tree, all the while being mocked him for plotting over his own house phone."

constate.32.d:0 "With the great success of Fordism in America, there comes as well some critics of the ideas presented in Ford literature. Especially within the Dearborn Independent, articles describing a massive worldwide conspiracy of Jews has created backlash against Fordism. The public at large is beginning to question Ford's aging logic, and as Ford is not a very public man, his responses to the press have only damned him further. To Ford's critics, including other members of the national corporatist alliance, racial rhetoric must be pushed subtly and anonymously. Most of the Committee including [CON.GetLeader] still agree with Ford's theories, but disagree on the medium to propagate those ideas as to not destabilize the new America's international relations."

Although the FBI has made the best public display of effort possible, there persist some underground press who do not believe syndicalists did the deed.

constate.34.d:0 "The most delicate part of the Business Plot is upon us. It appears Huey Long's will dictates that, in an event of his injury or incapacitation, his wife Rose Long was to take his post. Many die-hard Long followers have come to Washington, demanding Rose occupy the Presidential Mansion until Huey Long be found. They are met with an equal number of former Federalists who insist Huey Long's running mate, William Lemke, is the constitutionally-correct President. Siding with the constitution as our best defence is perhaps the more prudent path, though it could also be seen as an insult to Huey Long's widow and enflame the anger of the public even further."

constate.35.d.coverup:0 "Finally the Business Plot's master stroke is ready: exhausting and unresolved debates have worn down the willpower of Congress to elect a Vice President with absolute majority. A group of our more trustworthy Senators are ready to bring George Moseley into his own as Vice President, and to then serve as President until Huey is found. This involves a very specific alteration to Article II and the 12th Amendment to allow for Moseley as President Pro Tempore to assume office. Any attempts to uncover the truth behind Huey's disappearance have gone nowhere."
constate.35.d.uncovered:0 "Although he was maligned during the war for his almost nihilistic attitude, the journalist Westbrook Pegler has more than redeemed himself to the public today. Through investigative journalism, dodging government goons, and a dedication to facts over his own political reservations, the truth has been uncovered to the public. The underground press has exposed the true killers of Huey Long: his own bodygaurds. The blood money was traced right back to none other than interim president, George Moseley. The whole apparatus of state has moved to arrest Moseley, who implicated the War Powers Committee in what people are calling the 'Business Plot'. These men will be brought to justice, wherever they lay."
constate.35.d.scandal:0 "The Business Plot has succeeded, though it has come at great cost. Journalist Westbrook Pegler published an 'expose', accusing Moseley and others of conspiring to have Huey Long killed. Since its publication, Pegler's evidence has been proven flimsy and circumstantial - enough so that George Mosely was, in the end, considered more victim that perpetrator. The scandal has left a lingering taste among the public, but Moseley's allies in Congress were able to prevent any official hearings... and, after months of exhaustive and unresolved depates, have managed to arrange for him to serve as President until Huey is found. This involves a very specific alteration to Article II and the 12th Amendment, to allow for Moseley as President Pro Tempore to assume office."

constate.51.t:0 "Clare Hoffman causes Polio Outbreak"
constate.51.d:0 "It began in the Meeting Halls of the Silver Legion, the idea that vaccines were a syndicalist plot to poison America. This, coupled with the belief that America's public water has been poisoned by fluoride, has propelled many a new politician into office - none higher than that of former Congressman Clare Hoffman, who has gained a following within the Silver Legion. This has even led to the AFP ending Dr. Maurice Brodie's promising polio vaccine research. Now the summer heat has brought with it the largest Polio outbreak in American history. Although Clare is out of office now and the American Public Health Association has been rehabilitated, the damage is still done. Many Americans are now permanently crippled."

One group out in California called 'Mankind United' claims that America's savior is their local minister. Another has insinuated the government is willing to assist Catholic nations in their liberation. The potential threat to our power is limited, but at the same time disunity breeds contempt.

Now we must erase the great lie perpetrated by presidential candidate and Governor of Ohio, Warren G. Harding, to hide his black ancestry.

constate.58.d:0 "Today, famed author William Faulkner's seminal work 'The Sound and The Fury' released in theaters to critical acclaim. Most reviewers have praised the exaltation of the Compson family by the prodigal son, Jason. In the film, Jason sacrifices his hard-earned wealth to save his brother, Benjy, from a lifetime of pain, and saves his family's honor by sending his brother, Quentin, away to the barren North. Disaster strikes him when his niece, Miss Quentin, defrauds the family fortune and leaves town. Some critics have commented that the film is facetious and actually highlights the flaws in the Compson family and thus Southern society as a whole. Supporters of this interpretation cite author William Faulkner's liberal leanings, but those reviews were all published by known malcontents."

constate.59.d:0 "The wave of public education changes implemented by Simmons in order to solidify Christian Identity into the youth of America is nearly complete. His final act, which passed with unanimous approval by the delegates, is the Black Education Act. The Black Education Act totally redefines education practices for ethnic minority communities and, in particular, African-Americans. Notably it focuses the education of African-Americans for their role as laborers and distances them from older notions of religious unity across races. As part of his speech announcing the law, Simmons stated, 'There is no place for the Negro in the Anglo Saxon community above the level of laborer. What is the use of teaching the Negro child mathematics, when it cannot use it in practice?'."

constate.60.t:0 "The Black Belt Act"
constate.60.d:0 "One of the more controversial acts that Armstrong is proposing is to extend the 1899 Indian Appropriations Act into the African-American community. The proposed Black Belt Act would make communities in the South with majority African-American populations into a reserved space with independent public services. At least on paper, Armstrong claims these areas will be administered by African-Americans under the regime's jurisdiction, similar to the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Moreover the Act would strip citizenship and any previous state support to African-Americans nationwide. Black inhabitants of the region will be banned from entering White territory.

constate.61.t:0 "The Pass Laws"
constate.61.d:0 "Armstrong has begun issuing a passbook to African-Americans throughout the Commonwealth in anticipation of the Pass Laws taking effect next year. This law is similar to older internal passport used during the time of the Confederacy to identify freemen and slaves. The Church of Zion strongly discourages any comparisons to past laws and has defended their claims with violence. This has resulted in numerous African-Americans being forbidden from traveling outside of the south with plans to extend zoning into the rest of the Republic in order to intensify segregation, a policy in-line with Armstrong hatred of race-mixing."
constate.61.a:0 "Papers Please."

constate.62.t:0 "The Penal Act"
constate.62.d:0 "The Thirteenth Amendment made slavery illegal throughout the country. However, the Amendment allows for involuntary servitude as a punishment for crime. A new order passed by the delegates has increased the sentence time for moral crimes, and provided for more use of indentured labor in industry, thus being named the Penal Act. This Penal Labor has been given boost by our reviving of various Black Codes. The boisterous speeches Klan representatives delivers on the radio have tried to obfuscate the unfolding truth that slavery is back."

Groups like the International Labor Defence and the NAACP are now working together with the Red Cross to evacuate masses of people struggling to remain free. To the White Defense Leagues and their leaders, this plays into a long-standing fear of a united front against their rule. At the same time, the fewer the dissidents internally, the safer loyal Legionaries can sleep. The question is: what shall we do? Shall we let them leave, or shall we keep them here?"

Even the strongest pessimist could not anticipate the overflow of refugees the Black Star Line has picked up and dropped off in Monrovia. Families are reunited, and the Grain Coast now swells with thousands more Americo Liberians. Those more concerned with food production however have noted that we can't really handle a growing population at this time."
constate.64.d.mexico:0 "The existence of American refugees in Mexico has generally been ignored by the Central Government, as we have had amicable relations with America in the past. However, this Simmons is a threat to the entire continent, and the thousands more refugees crossing the Rio Grande tell of the Silver Legion's horrors. These refugees are far different from the Ambrose Bierce's' looking to retire, they are scarred and determined to end the Legionary regime of America."
constate.64.d.haiti:0 "Haiti has always portrayed themselves as the second home for African-Americans. A common story to tell was that the first Haitian was a refugee of Ethiopia that ran with such force that he only stopped when he fell into Haiti. Now we see this again coming out of the USA. The sinister Simmons should not have the right to do this to American people! We feel the refugees outrage, at the same time we struggle to determine whether our fragile economy can handle a labor surplus of this magnitude."

Families in Cuba have been calling for months to their families to escape the very real threat of a nationalist takeover. None of them anticipated that the bottleneck in Florida would be opened all at once, causing hundreds of boats to show up at Varadero today. The flood of refugees from America has clogged up our ports, tied up or landlines, and put strain on the government ministry to respond. What should be our answer?"

The AFP board members agreed that Long's rejection of a main campaign promise bodes ill for more 'morally-centred' legislation in the future. Francis Townsend, who joined Huey Long in order to push his Old-Age Revolving Pension Plan, agreed it was necessary to elect a new representative for the Share Our Wealth program, someone who wouldn't be beholden to the president's whims. After much debate, it was decided that newly-elected Louisiana Congressman, Gerald L.K. Smith, is far enough removed from Long yet still dedicated to social security.

General Patton, still leading the Fifth Army, has promised he will protect our right to rule the Commonwealth.

constate.80.d:0 "The Dixiecrats, who we tipped off about the 'arrest' of Long, have been useful in maintaining the facade that is Congress. The tedious proccess of replacing state representatives with Armstronists has meant that we have become more and more reliant on the Dixiecrats remaining content in the meantime. After a recent push by Chief Simmons to pass Amendments 22-24, bringing in a new "Grandfather" clause -depriving people of rights not enjoyed by their grandfather- and requiring a profession of faith in order to serve in Congress, the agenda has turned to Armstrong's final amendment: reserving private and government land for redistribution to Christians. This has spawned a surprise backlash. The Dixiecrats claim this eminent domain impedes the rights of states to their own land, something Simmons promised he wouldn't do. Armstrong is now in a bind. If he gives into the Dixiecrats, it will make him look weak at the very time he needs to look like he has all the answers. If he strongarms the amendment, as many of his advisers suggest, it dispels the illusion of democracy we so dearly need to maintain."

constate.81.d:0 "Resentment against the Silver Legion outpost in Baltimore has been building for the past several weeks. After a poorly-written passion play performed to entice membership was mocked in the city's newspapers, Legion members have begun to feel isolated from the community, and have begun travelling in armed groups. Tensions rose, and the breaking point came when the Baltimore police came upon a Legionaire lynching - and attacked the Legionaries. A full-blown riot in the streets has resulted, and the entire situation has been subsequently mishandled by the Maryland National Guard, who appear to not know which side to take. If we intervene to take the Legionaries out of the fighting, our favoritism will be obvious and it will cost us. If we leave them in the riots, however, it not only threatens to turn into a national scandal but might also call into question our loyalty to the Silver Legion. Still, some are suggesting this betrayal of our own could save face with the public by providing us the appearance of neutrality."

During that time, no real evidence was found of the Silver Legion's involvement in the entire debacle, and though the Silver Legion's headquarters in Baltimore was breached as important documents were still being disposed of, none of those papers found their way into the hands of anyone who could do damage. The entire incident was reported on as an attempted syndicalist coup against the Simmons administration, with the ensuing public sympathy providing plenty of leeway for government action to be taken against figures of suspect loyalty. This windfall of support has emboldend Simmons, who claims he predicted the outcome as biblical fact. Simmons recalled Herbert W. Armstrong to the capital, and has now announced a second book detailing his further predictions for America based on his reading of the bible. The Silver Legion, under Simmons's leadership, hopes to fufill the promises within this book in the coming years."

While dealing with the rioters, the Silver Legion headquarters in Baltimore was breached as important documents were still being disposed of. Papers were seized and somehow found their way into the hands of the newspapers, who published damning evidence of plans to restrict or outright remove the rights of African-Americans. Public outrage spread rapidly, but thankfully enough work had already been done to ensure loyalty in and outside of the adminstration. For weeks, denials were issued, stern investigations made, and several scapegoats offered... until finally the worst of it was passed. The political backlash has still damaged the people's faith in the Commonwealth, but the Silver Legion has placed enough loyalists within positions of power that we are now secure. They cannot dislodge us."

While dealing with the rioters, the Silver Legion headquarters in Baltimore was breached as important documents were still being disposed of. Papers were seized and somehow found their way into the hands of the newspapers, who have published evidence of a planned 'Black Belt' which would have put African-Americans under the Indian Reservation system. The outraged public has rallied resistance to Simmons's administration, and it appears out job was not complete... the Silver Legion does not have enough loyalists in position to keep the government safe. The radio is alive with talk of rebellion.

The inevitable occurred, though we can perhaps be thankful that Patton was fired on first. An angry officer shouted 'traitor' and then fired, and as Patton fell his line immediately opened fire. Hundreds died on each side, but even the most unreasonable newspaper is hesitant to suggest afterwards that Patton's men were doing anything more than trying to maintain order in a chaotic situation. Patton succumbed to his injuries two days later, and has all but been declared a martyr in the continuing battle against public disorder in America."

While the plants managed to stop the march from gaining any momentum, preventing any attempt at a coup, it didn't stop a number of prominent officers from getting on stage and making impassioned speeches against the 'undemocratic' trial of Huey Long and the undermining of American democracy. Some newspapers mocked the chaos, but many others picked up on and spread the speeches, and the officers' words have reached the ears of many in the public who feel the same."

The two proposals that caught the most interest are ones authored by Robert Goddard and Vannevar Bush, each proposing an expensive weapon project to deter invasions. Fortunately, both men were recovered from their respective hiding places, and persuaded into updating their proposals. Goddard's plan is for a liquid fuel rocket to deliver stable explosive payloads across long distances.

Therefore, Bush has had to resort to industrial technicians which extended the timeline. Finally, after much testing and assistance from George Kistiakowsky, the first atomic bomb is tested.

There is a longing among many to return to the stability of the Stars and Stripes, even if things have irrevocably changed.

News agencies were soon to arrive on the scene, when suddenly the crowd began unfurling the battle flag of the old Confederacy. Sensing an impending political disaster, Huey Long had his men to confiscate these radical symbols of the Civil War. When the governors arrived, the press only saw the image of a defiant America determined to fight the illegitimate powers of federal corruption and syndicalist oppression.

A second Declaration of Independence was drafted in Baton Rouge over the course of a few days, painstakingly emulating the original conceit of the American Revolution. This declaration outlined the lack of protection the federal government gave to citizens, and the role of the state to protect the welfare of the poor. The signatories declare that it is within their constitutional right to organize a militia against tyranny, and that the federal government's deadline should not only be ignored it must be defied."

Some came to wish Long well and stayed, others simply to court favour with the revolution. These meetings in Baton Rouge began to take on a Congressional appearance, with Coughlin standing as the President of the attending senators. Aware of the growing determination to defy the federal government, and that this lack of willingness to negotiate meant civil war was all but certain, a large number of politicians have slinked away to the north... though those that remain seem more determined than ever to see victory."

With his approval, we have begun seizing vehicles from the civilian populace, although to our surprise, some proud patriots line up next to our storages to volunteer their vehicles for the incoming fight.

After finishing a rigorous conditioning and training program started two weeks ago, a lottery was made to decide the jumping order of the experimental paradropping platoon made up of volunteers. When the Douglas C-33 took off from the Lawson Air Field and finally was put into position to start the experiment, Second Lieutenant William T. Ryder became the first American Paratrooper after making his jump and landing near Fort Benning. The second man, however, refused to jump, and so the first enlisted man to become a paratrooper was Pvt. William N. "Red" King, and then the remaining 8 platoon members in the aircraft. After their touchdown, they quickly reached the rendezvous point and completed their excercise goals, making the experiment a success."

constate.502.d:0 "With the success of our scheduled mass jumps and with the blessing of General Patton, Fort Benning had begun taking volunteers for paratrooper units. While originally the high training standards and relatively high mortal risk initially caused few volunteers to show up, the high command authorized a triplication of the paratrooper wage as opposed to the foot soldier wage. Soon enough, the 501st Parachute Battalion was formed, quickly followed by other battalions and regiments. After a week recruitment, the number of volunteers was enough to form 5 paratrooper divisions for us to utilize. While these divisions still lack combat experience, this breakthrough in Airborne tactics should not be underestimated, and the High Command is looking forward to seeing their investment in these divisions pay off."

COR_GEORGE_MOSELEY_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W September 28, 1874, in Evanston, Illinois, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W George Van Horn Moseley graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1899 as a cavalry second lieutenant. He would serve in the Spanish American War commanding the 9th Cavalry Regiment where he even managed to achieve a major breakthrough against Ludovico Arejola, prompting a promotion to first lieutenant and a transfer to the 1st Cavalry Regiment. There he'd serve as Aide-de-Camp for Brigadier General J.M. Bell and J.M. Lee for the remainder of the campaign, fulfilling several staff roles in the rear. He'd be transferred back to the US in 1904, and would serve as a staff member of the Texas Headquarters, until being promoted to Captain in 1906. He'd continue to fill a variety of staff roles while at the same time attending the Army Staff College and the Army War College, of which he graduated in 1909 and 1911 respectively. He took part in Pershing's punitive expedition, providing logistical support to Pershing, and earning him the promotion to major. After commanding the Second Field Artillery Brigade, he was detailed as assistant to General Dawes in organizing the Bureau of the Budget in 1921, after which he was promoted to Brigadier General for his remarkable performance. He'd become Executive Assistant to the Assistant Secretary of War and was put in charge of the Industrial Preparedness sector, which got him his promotion to Major General. In 1934 he had a major fall out with General MacArthur, and with the country's collapse into civil war, Moseley's first course of action was to leave the Federal Army and join the AUS Army in the south, where his experience and the lack of capable staff granted him an immediate promotion to Field Marshall by Huey Long.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Has displayed strong anti-immigrant and anti-semitic views both publicly and privately.\n- Along with Charles Lindbergh, Moseley has been seen in frequent meetings with important businessmen from outside the military sphere, and his loyalty to Huey Long is proving to be dubious at best."
COR_GEORGE_PATTON_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W November 11, 1885, in San Gabriel, California, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W George Smith Patton Jr., a fan of military history books from an early age, joined the Virginia Military Institute in 1903. In his second year, he was nominated for West Point, and while he performed excellently in the drill procedures at West Point, his academic performance was so bad that he was forced to repeat his first year. Despite all setbacks, he graduated as a cavalry second lieutenant in 1909 and was assigned with the 15th Cavalry Regiment. In 1912, his athletic skills made him the army's choice to represent the United States for the first modern Pentathlon in the Stockholm Olympic games, ranking fifth out of forty two participants. With the launching of the punitive expedition, Patton became Pershing's Aide-de-Camp during the largely unsuccessful expedition, but this strengthened ties between them and Patton became an almost permanent member of his staff and was promoted to Captain soon enough. He was promoted to Major in June 31, 1920 and began taking an interest in the Weltkrieg’s use of mechanized warfare. In 1923 he'd graduate from the Cavalry's Field Officer's Course, from the Command and General Staff College in 1924 and the Army War College in 1932. During the protests of the Bonus Army, Patton had a major falling out with MacArthur, after which Patton vocally opposed his colleague constantly, and he decided to leave to the AUS after his former CO, Fox Conner, convinced him that the AUS was the true american government, and that the Federal Government was bound to fail if decisive action wasn't taken. With his reputation preceding him, Huey Long decided to skip the rank of general and name Patton an outright Field Marshall, a role which Patton claims to be more than prepared to fulfill.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- While publicly his loyalty remains unquestioned, his former friendship with Dwight Eisenhower make many members of the staff distrustful of Patton\n- Has displayed strong racist views in public."

He graduated from the Officers' School at Fort Benjamin Harrison in Indiana in 1917, and was transferred to the Aviation Division of the Army Signal Corps soon after. He earned his wings in 1919 and remained in service after the air branch was turned into the Air Corps. In 1931, he became Chief of Pursuit Section at Air Corps Tactical School, and would take charge of the 1st Pursuit Group of Alabama's Aerobatic Team, becoming a regional celebrity of his aerial feats. As 1937 loomed over, Chennault was considering resignation as the staff in Washington refused to promote him beyond Captain, considering him unfit for duty due to his declining health. When the American Civil War began, Chennault sided with the former Governor of Louisiana, giving Huey a small hike in recruitment as passionate observers of Chennault's performances filled the recruiting booths, and in exchange, Huey granted Chennault the honorary rank of Brigadier General for his service to the American Union State\n§YImportant Notes:§W- His health has been slowly deteriorating, with deafness and chronic bronchitis being the main issues Chennault will have to face sooner or later."

He'd stay as a teacher in West Point and marry Gladys Easterbrook in his time at the academy. In 1921, he began teaching Chemistry in West Point as well and in 1926, he graduated from the company officer course at the Infantry School in Fort Benning. A year later, he'd undergo and successfully complete an advanced course at the Field Artillery School at Fort Sill. After that, Collins taught weapons and tactics at the Infantry School from 1927 to 1932 where he requested a transfer to the Philippine Division from 1933 to 1934 and became a major. In 1935 and 1936, he graduated from Army Industrial College and the Army War College reaching the rank of lieutenant colonel. With the outbreak of the Civil War, Collins aligned with Patton within the army, and both chose to leave southwards to join Huey Long's forces. When Patton was nominated as Field Marshall by Huey Long himself, Patton requested the promotion of Collins to Brigadier General which was granted by the Southern Demagogue.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- An extremely talented yet aggressive commanding officer, his skills shine the most when leading an attack on the enemy rather than playing on the defence."

Undeterred, he enlisted in the army in 1906 as a private, where he quickly rose to the rank of sergeant in 1907 and earned a commission as a second lieutenant in 1909. He joined Pershing during the Punitive Expedition, where he met George S. Patton and George Marshall, and would remain in the Mexican border for the rest of the late 1910s, facing off several small skirmisher groups with the 6th Infantry Regiment. After being promoted to Major for his service at the border, he attended the Command and General Staff College, graduating in 1925 and becoming a member of the Infantry Board at Fort Benning. In 1934, graduated from the Army War College, earning him his promotion to lieutenant colonel. With Patton and Marshall vocally opposing MacArthur, Hodges was forced to choose between either one of his friends in case the situation deteriorated. He chose the former, as Patton managed to sway Hodges into joining him in the AUS Army, where the now Field Marshal Patton has offered his friend Hodges an early promotion to Brigadier General."

Soon afterwards the regiment was sent overseas to Mindanao, in the Philippines, in January 1910 and remained there for another two-and-a-half years, where Simpson participated in the suppression of the Moro Rebellion. He returned to the United States with his regiment in 1912 and, being stationed at Fort Bliss, remained there as a company commander until, now promoted to first lieutenant, he fought in Pershing's Punitive Expedition in 1916. In February 1917 he became aide-de-camp to Major General George Bell, Jr., who commanded the El Paso Military District. Since 1919, Simpson has filled several staff appointments and attended military schools and courses and would be promoted in early 1921 to Captain. Simpson served with the General Staff until 1932 where he began teaching military science and tactics at Pomona College until 1936, being promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1934. As the country spiralled out of control, Simpson became more and more aligned with Huey Long's vision of America as time passed, and when Huey finally proclaimed the American Union State, Simpson presented his services to what he sees as the true American government.

On 1 April 1916, he was promoted to first lieutenant and he was transferred to the newly activated 9th Field Artillery at the Schofield Barracks in Hawaii and promoted to Captain in early 1917. In May 1919, Devers was sent on a three-month temporary duty assignment to study the Weltkrieg in Europe. He attended the Preußische Kriegsakademie in Berlin to study the equipment and tactics used by both sides during the Weltkrieg. He was promoted to major on 1920 and he was later selected to attend the Command and General Staff School, graduating in 1925. He was then posted to Fort Sill as the director the Field Artillery School's Gunnery Department until 31 August 1929 where Devers was transferred to Washington, D.C., to serve on the staff of the Chief of Field Artillery. In 1932, he was chosen to attend the Army War College and graduated on June 1933. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 26 February 1934. With the country spiralling into Civil War, Devers found himself fighting more and more against his superiors inability to react to internal issues, starting a deep rivalry between him and Dwight Eisenhower, even putting him at odds with his old friend Leslie McNair. When Huey Long declared the Union State, Devers decided that MacArthur and his staff was a liability for America, and promptly volunteered for the AUS officer corp, where he was promoted to Field Marshall along with George Patton."
