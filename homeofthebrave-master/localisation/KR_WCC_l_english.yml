WCC_expand_air_corps_tactical_school_desc:0 "We are in need of a space to train new pilots for the variety of operations the Air Force handles.

WCC_screaming_eagles_desc:0 "General John C.H. Lee is insisting on starting off a new experiment in Air Assaults done in response to the Hang-glider operations pioneered in Europe.

WCC_expand_the_WCCAC:0 "Expand the WCCAC"
WCC_expand_the_WCCAC_desc:0 "The United States Air Army Corps, in service since 1926, has largely remained on the sidelines of military development. Despite receiving a meager budget, they've yet managed to innovate in many aspects and High Command barely sees any reason to reform. Provided High Command's disputes in the past few years with Airmen, it has been decided they'd be better off remaining as an integral part of the Army."
WCC_create_the_WCCAF:0 "Create the WCCAF"
WCC_create_the_WCCAF_desc:0 "The United States Air Army Force is the success of both the airman and the politician. With the dream of Billy Mitchell realized in all but name, we can now focus on improving on Harold L. George's doctrine and enhancing America's long range strike capabilities."
WCC_modernize_cavalry_tactics:0 "Modernize Cavalry Tactics"
WCC_modernize_cavalry_tactics_desc:0 "It was apparent from our observers in the Weltkreig that new tactics and technologies are becoming vital in the battlefield.

WCC_mechanization_program:0 "Mechanization Program"
WCC_mechanization_program_desc:0 "The speeds Chaffe is promising on new vehicles will require a systematic change in how we build and maintain military vehicles."
WCC_top_notch_artillery:0 "Top-Notch Artillery"
WCC_top_notch_artillery_desc:0 "Artillery peices will need to be stronger as well as lighter if we are to respond to battlefield changes as the plan dictates. McNair's expertise in the 1920s with the Examining boards seems to have not gone to waste, and he has proposed an overhaul of the American Artillery production which he projects will lead to artillery pieces being easier to produce and repair, as well as more accurate on the battlefield."
WCC_production_priority:0 "Production Prioritization"
WCC_production_priority_desc:0 "As our War Industry hums along, McNair has stressed the necessity of the usage of both Anti Air and Anti Tank cannons to stop both armored and aerial threats dead in their tracks.

WCC_CAS_doctrine:0 "Air-To-Ground Cooperation Excercises"
WCC_CAS_doctrine_desc:0 "While the WCCAC has technically worked with the Army for well over a decade, they have hardly ever worked together.

WCC_CAS_model:0 "CAS Model Development"
WCC_CAS_model_desc:0 "As the Air Corps never intended to be integrated into the army, hardly any development has gone into newer Close Air Support Models. Thankfully, Contractors have already been kind enough to provide us with prototypes like the Brewster XSBA-1 and the already aging Northrop A-17 'Drifter'. High Command will need to choose carefully who'll become our main Attack Bomber if we wish to succeed..."
WCC_strategic_bomber_development:0 "Strategic Bomber Development"
WCC_strategic_bomber_development_desc:0 "America hardly has any enemies within attack range to fear. As such, there has been a generalized thought that has been taking over the WCCAF, spread by a group led by famous airmen like Carl Spaatz. The Army has dubbed them the 'Bomber Mafia' due to their methods, and this 'Bomber Mafia' is now requesting the funding to further expand on their long range strike plans."
WCC_strategic_bombing_doctrine:0 "Strategic Bombing Doctrine"
WCC_strategic_bombing_doctrine_desc:0 "The idea pushed by Spaatz and his acquaintances is a rather simple one: The Enemy won't be able to continue fighting if the home for which they are fighting for no longer exists. By destroying both their industry and their fighting spirit at the homefront, our troops will prevail both in morale and equipment on the frontline."
WCC_long_range_escorts:0 "Long Range Escorts"
WCC_long_range_escorts_desc:0 "While having better bombers is vital to win the war of tomorrow at the enemy's doorstep, these bombers can seldom operate on their own. They will need an escort capable of facing off enemy fighters and come back in one piece. Luckily for us, plane designer Kelly Johnson has contacted us with a new and innovative design: The P-38, dubbed 'The Lightning'."

Thankfully for us, our private contractors have come up with the NA-40, which could serve as a baseline to a new flexible bomber model, which the airmen insist on naming after Billy Mitchell despite High Command's protests. We shall fund these development efforts"
WCC_Quesada_CAS:0 "Quesada's Close Air Support"
WCC_Quesada_CAS_desc:0 "General Quesada has a very hands-on attitude to directing Air missions, and his approach to air tactics is near revolutionary for our young Air Force. Let us fund his efforts and help distribute his manuals to pilots so our CAS doctrine may be the best in the world!"
WCC_new_arms_factories:0 "New Arms Factories"
WCC_new_arms_factories_desc:0 "The main trouble with creating a military industry is that facilities under our control were already reduced from the Great Depression to reduce redundancies. We have had to expand facilities and repurpose old buildings in order to manufacture parts needed for heavy weapons in our territory."
WCC_new_tank_assemblies:0 "New Tank Assemblies"
WCC_new_tank_assemblies_desc:0 "Armored warfare will change the face of the battlefield forever. We cannot sid idly as the world rearms, and with the Tank, we may be able to beat our enemies in a matter of weeks instead of years. As such, it would be a priority for us to build more of these deadly machines, so that we may be ready for fight for freedom not only in America, but on the whole world."
WCC_woman_army_corps:0 "Create the Women's Army Corps"
WCC_woman_army_corps_desc:0 "Despite protests from socially conservative elements in the US Army, the Commander in Chief has stood firm in defence of the Women’s Army Corps. Led by Secretary of the Department of Health, Oveta Hobby, the WAC has received more than twice their requested number of volunteers. Women’s Auxiliary will help maintain and safeguard our weapons of war, and keep our massive supply chain working."
WCC_new_rifle_development:0 "Rifle Improvements"
WCC_new_rifle_development_desc:0 "While the M1 Garand managed to see us through the Civil War, its flaws were as noticeable when it was adopted as they are now. However, with the criticism we have gathered during the civil war, we have contacted the original designer, and he has assured us that by redesigning the barrel, gas cylinder, and front sight assembly, he will make the Garand an even more reliable and deadly weapon."
WCC_tis_ill_defend:0 "'This We'll Defend'"
WCC_tis_ill_defend_desc:0 "The US Army has reached a new peak in both size and efficiency. We can rely on them to defend our values both domestically and abroad, and in the process, High Command has managed to learn some valuable lessons that give us an edge over inexperienced militaries."

WCC_hierarchical_reorganization:0 "Hierarchical Reorganization"
WCC_hierarchical_reorganization_desc:0 "The meritocracy in the US Army has fallen to the wayside for nepotism and incompetence. We must reaffirm the code of the US Army and ingrain this in our staff hierarchy."
WCC_joint_chiefs_of_staff:0 "Joint Chiefs of Staff"
WCC_joint_chiefs_of_staff_desc:0 "The disputes common in the Federal inter-service politics persist in our own government. In order to avoid this interdisciplinary contention from spilling over, we must ensure that all our Chiefs of Staff are given equal attention."

WCC_a_gun_for_every_hand:0 "A Gun for Every Hand"
WCC_a_gun_for_every_hand_desc:0 "A priority of General Craig is not only the Mobilization of large infantry units, but the consistency of supplies for them. As such, he insists that a second budget needs to be drawn, one that favours Weapon contractors heavily to produce more equipment so our troops at the front may be able to fight with a full kit against any threat."
WCC_engineer_corps_expansion:0 "Engineer Corps Expansion"
WCC_engineer_corps_expansion_desc:0 "We are finally able to provide enough infrastructure and planning to provide Engineering Corps in the field. Through coordinating our intelligence network with scouting and surveillance systems, we are able to ensure that non-combat elements in battle are accounted for and able to complete their tasks."
WCC_american_auto_industry:0 "American Auto Industry"
WCC_american_auto_industry_desc:0 "Since the invention of the Automobile, it has been taken up in earnest by the people of America. Most of the factories for cars are in the north where the syndicalists are running things. However, J. Kaiser has moved North, so we should encourage other companies to follow in his footsteps."
WCC_cult_of_aviation:0 "Spaatz's Air Superiority"
WCC_cult_of_aviation_desc:0 "General Carl Spaatz has long since been growing in notoriety within the WCCAC and WCCAF. The success of his ideas on the field of battle have proven that Spaatz's approach to air warfare may be correct, and as such, the Army should focus on promoting and distributing manuals regardless of disagreements with the 'Bomber Mafia' so that our pilots may learn and apply his ideas on the skies."

WCC_new_admirals:0 "New Admirals"

### Events - Pre Election ###

wcc.1.t:0 "The United States in 1936"
wcc.1.d:0 "In 1936, the United States of America is gripped by unrelenting crisis. At first relieved it had managed to avoid the horrors of the Weltkrieg, Woodrow Wilson was the first US presidents to run and win a third-term as the “Man Who Kept the Peace” alongside his new running mate former Attorney General Alexander Mitchell Palmer. Unfortunately, good feelings did not last long as Wilson suffered a stroke shortly after his election which set off a constitutional crises and left increasing power in the hands of Palmer until Wilson finally died in late 1923. Palmer and the Wilson cabinet reacted to the French and British Revolutions and growth of American syndicalism with increasingly extreme crackdowns on union organizing and eventually a slew of organizations suspected to have connections to the radical left. As workers became radicalized in response and anarchist bombers made several attempts on Palmer’s life the political situation deteriorated alongside the economy as a combination of strikes and a loss of trading partners. Palmer’s controversial presidency ended with the election of Herbert Hoover in 1928 whom attempted to calm the situation with a “Return to Normalcy” by re-legalizing many non-violent syndicalist outlets but this brief respite from chaos did not last as a cumulation of speculative investing sent the United States spiraling into the Great Panic and allowed the Berlin Stock Market to take its place at the forefront of the world economy.\n\nThe election of Herbert Hoover in 1928, while initially promising, failed entirely to reverse the decline of the American economy, and by 1936 the country had spent over a decade in the midst of the worst financial crisis it had ever seen. This fueled the rise of radical politics in America from the far-left Socialist Party of America, the populist Share the Wealth Society under Huey Long and his national America First Party and the far-right Old Democratic Party, a far-right faction of the Democratic Party that places the blame of syndicalist and civil rights uprisings at the feet of immigrants, Republican cosmopolitism and liberal toleration of the left. Hoover's contentious re-election by means of the House of Representatives in 1932, and the ongoing Great Depression means that these problems are unlikely to be resolved any time soon. Many throughout the country fear the upheaval that would result should one of the extreme parties come to power, or should the Depression continue unabated."
wcc.1.a:0 "God Save America."

wcc.2.t:0 "Black Monday hits America"
wcc.2.d:0 "Despite the political turmoil and ineffectual economic relief programs, it seemed to many as if the economy of the United States might finally be undergoing a slow recovery after the Wall Street Crash of 1925. Black Monday has put an end to such hopes, and has sounded the death-knell for an already ailing economy. Republicans and Democrats have both pledged to fix the economy should they win the election, though public confidence in them is rapidly waning. Both Reed and Long have railed hard against the corrupt banking and political sectors, which they blame for allowing the crash to happen."
wcc.2.a:0 "This is just not our year."

wcc.3.t:0 "The Coalition Ticket?"
wcc.3.d:0 "The 1936 election is looking to be one of the most contentious in American history. Many politicians within the upper circle of the Republican and Democratic Parties fear that a victory by the Socialist Party of America, the America First Party or the Old Democrats would mean the end of America and the American way of life.\n\nIn order to avoid this, a plan has been proposed within the halls of power to form a coalition ticket between the mainstream Republican and Democratic Parties with current Vice President Republican Curtis as the presidential candidate and a Democrat as vice-president. As part of the agreement the Republicans will not run candidates in the “Solid South” to give traditional democrats a better chance of winning and in return the Democratic Party will not run a presidential candidate this year. This plan is unlikely to be popular with lower ranking members of the parties, but it may be the only thing that can prevent the radical parties from gaining strength."
wcc.3.a:0 "A Coalition, if you can keep it."
wcc.3.b:0 "A Coalition would debase the democratic system."

wcc.4.t:0 "Southern Democrats Complain"
wcc.4.d:0 "Although the coalition is showing signs of success, there is already some dissent from the various factions. The loudest voices belong to those of the Southern Democrats, many of whom are much more conservative and are facing stiff competition from the America First Party candidates and primary challenges from the Old Democrats. The coalition has been largely dominated by northern Democrats and Republicans and we could try and force a compromise by promising to appoint southern Democrats to the cabinet and other positions of power if we win. Of course, we could also ignore their protest and focus on winning the election instead."
wcc.4.a:0 "Let them complain, where else will they go?"
wcc.4.b:0 "Promise to appoint them to the cabinet."

wcc.5.t:0 "Disunity within the coalition"
wcc.5.d:0 "The Democratic and Republican parties have long been at odds since they came to national prominence. As we try to keep our coalition party together, a number of Democrats and Republicans have been getting into verbal shouting matches in Congress. While they are just minor members, the conflict could destabilize the whole coalition if it is allowed to spread. We can either come down hard on one side, or try to force some kind of compromise by pressuring rabble rousers to keep still until after the election – either way, it should end public dissent for now."
wcc.5.a:0 "Side with the Democrats."
wcc.5.b:0 "Force a compromise."
wcc.5.c:0 "Side with the Republicans."

wcc.6.t:0 "Curtis' Nomination"
wcc.6.d:0 "In a massive rally in Sacramento with leading members from the Republican and Democratic Parties, Vice-President Charles Curtis himself came out to accept his nomination as the Coalition presidential candidate. This massive rally has been surprisingly well received by the press and those attending it. Hopefully, it can translate to election results."
wcc.6.a:0 "Let us pray that this helps us."

wcc.7.t:0 "Disunity within the coalition"
wcc.7.d:0 "In Iowa, a number of Progressives have gotten into a conflict with the Republicans. The Republicans are accusing the Progressives of alienating people needed to win the election while the Progressives are accusing the Republicans of not pushing for the policies needed to end the Depression. This fighting is driving a wedge in the coalition."
wcc.7.a:0 "Side with the Republicans."
wcc.7.b:0 "Force a compromise."
wcc.7.c:0 "Side with the Progressives."

wcc.8.t:0 "Nominating Quentin Roosevelt"
wcc.8.d:0 "Since the nomination of Senator Curtis as the presidential candidate, the politically minded have discussed with great interest the likely vice-presidential candidate. Finally putting the rumours to rest, Quentin Roosevelt was announced as the VP for the coalition ticket yesterday in New York City. In his announcement, he emphasized wanting to help bring major reforms to the country through a plan called the Fair Deal. Though this plan was denounced by the SPA and AFP as being nowhere near enough to help the average American, economists believe that it may be enough to end the Depression."
wcc.8.a:0 "A deal that is fair and a deal that is square."

wcc.9.t:0 "Indian Citizenship Act"
wcc.9.d:0 "In order to gain more sympathy from the North and the West, it has been proposed by the Senate and the House that the Indian Citizenship Bill be passed, effectively elevating all indigenous peoples of the United States from second-class citizens to full citizenship. Northeastern and Western politicians in both the major parties support this, while some Southern Democrats and Northern Republicans have deemed it frivolous."
wcc.9.a:0 "Pass the Act, hopefully, this will gain us some sympathy!"
wcc.9.b:0 "Veto the Bill, this is no time for populism."

wcc.10.t:0 "The Coalition falls apart!"
wcc.10.d:0 "The conflicts within the Coalition party have spiraled out of control and today it seems that the coalition party cannot stand together in Congress. The Republicans, Democrats and Progressives have all gone their separate ways back to their old rhetoric. The ever-present Capitol rumour mill has it that General Douglas MacArthur could save America, should either Reed or Long take over."
wcc.10.a:0 "God save America, for nobody else can…"

wcc.11.t:0 "Increasing Radicalization"
wcc.11.d:0 "With the Democrats and Republicans fighting among themselves, as usual, more and more Americans are feeling alienated from the traditional big two and are flocking to the radical AFP and SPA throughout the country. In these dark times, the distinction between genuine social reform and graft is hard to distinguish. Those under the radical banner in their political enclaves have received some social welfare. Share Our Wealth donations from the AFP, and International Red Aid from the SPA. The party machine of these radicals utilizes mass media to a much stronger degree than either the Republicans or Democrats. It is looking more and more like the 1936 election will come down to Reed or Long."
wcc.11.a:0 "This is really bad."

wcc.12.t:0 "Progressives flock to the AFP"
wcc.12.d:0 "Minnesota, which had long been a bastion of the Progressive Senator Floyd Curtis, has finally flipped. Many people are turning away from Senator Curtis on the direction of the IWW and SPA. Various unions have held rallies for the SPA, and attendance far outstrips our ability to out-shout them."
wcc.12.a:0 "Is it something in the water?"

wcc.olddemocrats1.t:0 "Old Democrats announce Nominee"
wcc.olddemocrats1.d:0 "The Old Democrats have officially announced there candidacy for President, denouncing the more centrist-conservative wing of the Democratic Party and its liberal members as 'sell-out' to Republicans and Washington Bureaucrats. A faction formed as a reaction to the growth of syndicalism and their support of a radicalized civil rights movements as well as A. Mitchell Palmer's attempts to weaken the resurgent Klan through federal crackdowns in Southern States, Republican tariffs that harmed agriculture have led to greater support for the movement. Today they declared their nominee for president to be William H. Murray who said that he's running a campaign against "Communists, Corporations and Coons". He received support from the National Democrats, an informal name for a group of national-corporatist Northern Democrats lead by Charles Lindbergh and Henry Ford, as well as the National Klan."
wcc.olddemocrats1.a:0 "Not even more radical candidates"

wcc.13.t:0 "Southern Democrat voters align with the Old Democrats"
wcc.13.d:0 "The South has long been considered the heartland of the traditional Democratic elites but this may not be the case for much longer, as polls show a massive spike in votes for the Old Democrats and support for their nominee. On a radio broadcast, William H. Murray spoke at length about his plans for America and ending threats to "the white way of life". It seems that Old Democrat support is growing stronger by the day and they have pledged to run campaigns against mainstream Democrats who continue working with the Republican party."
wcc.13.a:0 "What devious conmen."

wcc.14.t:0 "MacArthur speaks to Hoover"
wcc.14.d:0 "MacArthur has spoken to President Hoover privately about a contingency plan called War Plan White, a military plan for dealing with a possible armed uprising of US citizens. The plan would call on MacArthur to take emergency action to protect the country, and re-erect old barricades in Washington D.C. This plan can be engaged even from outside Washington D.C, at the Washington Arsenal. While the plan has obviously not been made public, we at least have it as a contingency if the radicals enact one of their revolutions from within government."
wcc.14.a:0 "Let us hope this is not needed."

wcc.15.t:0 "The Battle of the Overpass"
wcc.15.d:0 "In Detroit, Michigan, the automotive capital of the world, Walter Reuther and Richard Frankenstein, the leaders of the United Auto Workers association, called a general strike against the Ford Motor Company and proclaim themselves for 'Unionism, Not Ford-ism', demanding higher pay and fewer hours for automotive workers.\n\nAt 2:00 PM today, a photographer from the Detroit Free Press asked to take a photo of the leaders of the UAW standing on the overpass with the Ford sign in the background. While they were posing, a group of forty men from the Ford's Service Department, approached them from behind and began to beat them with their batons. The group then continued their attack on some of the beret-wearing women present to pass out leaflets."
wcc.15.a:0 "This will hurt us more than it hurt the Unionists!"

wcc.16.t:0 "Representatives Retiring"
wcc.16.d:0 "Many Republicans and Democratic Representatives have announced that this year will be their last year in Congress. While many retirees claim old age motivated them, rumours of gang intimidation by SPA and AFP Congressmen reminds many of the Congressional brawl between Charles Sumner and Preston Brooks. The unprecedented rate of their retirement has given hope to the AFP and SPA that they can win these open elections."
wcc.16.a:0 "Let us hope they get good replacements."

wcc.17.t:0 "Violence between radicals"
wcc.17.d:0 "In a number of major cities, conflicts between supporters of the America First Party, Old Democrats and the Socialist Party have broken out in violence. Partisan fist fights and even shoot-outs are starting to become a regular occurrence throughout the country as the country spirals ever deeper into chaos. While public eruptions are easy to counter, the enclaves these radicals have cut out of city blocks run on graft are harder to stop."
wcc.17.a:0 "This is just not our year."

wcc.18.t:0 "Charles Coughlin's Radio Broadcasts"
wcc.18.d:0 "Three years ago today, Father Charles Coughlin began a weekly radio broadcast in America, and now has an audience of over 50 million people. He is a conspiracy-minded populist who claims that the Syndicalist Revolution in France was 'fomented by the German elite' and that the Berlin Stock Market Crash is an 'International conspiracy of Bankers' and somehow people still tune in to his radical agenda which calls for a near-overthrow of the US government. His extreme and unorthodox rhetoric is barely tolerated by the Church, and the Pope is expected to make a decision whether to ask the United States government to shut down his broadcast so that his message cannot reach the public."
wcc.18.a:0 "Coughlin is a becoming a danger to the public, shut him down."
wcc.18.b:0 "I hate what he says, but I defend his right to say it."

wcc.19.t:0 "Huey Long Speaks"
wcc.19.d:0 "The Democratic Party and the Republican Party were just like the old patent medicine drummer that used to come around our county. He had two bottles of medicine. He'd play the banjo and he'd sell two bottles of medicine.\n\nOne of those bottles of medicine was called High Popalorum and another one of those bottles of medicine was called Low Popahirum.\n\nFinally somebody around there said is there any difference in these bottles of medicines? 'Oh,' he said, 'considerable. They're both good but they're different,' he said.\n\n'That High Popalorum is made from the bark off the tree that we take from the top down. And that Low Popahirum is made from the bark that we take from the root up.'\n\nAnd the only difference that I have found between the Democratic leadership and the Republican leadership was that one of 'em was skinning you from the ankle up and the other from the ear down — when I got to Congress."
wcc.19.a:0 "Homely sayings do not win elections."

wcc.20.t:0 "Death of Big Bill Haywood"
wcc.20.d:0 "Today one of the titans of the Industrial Workers of the World, William 'Big Bill' Haywood, has passed away. His death marks the passing of a torch. Elizabeth Gurley Flynn spoke at the funeral saying 'History has a long-range perspective. It ultimately passes stern judgement on tyrants and vindicates those who fought, suffered, were imprisoned, and died for human freedom, against political oppression and economic slavery.'\n\nMany other leaders within various Union organizations including his rivals in the AFL also spoke at his funeral as well as leaders within the Socialist Party of America. Jack Reed also spoke at the funeral ending his speech with some of Haywood's quotes, 'If the workers are organized, all they have to do is to put their hands in their pockets and they have got the capitalist class whipped. A strike is an incipient revolution. Many large revolutions have grown out of a small strike. Remember that you are fighting more than your own fight. You are fighting for the entire working class and you must stand together.'"
wcc.20.a:0 "I already miss him."

wcc.21.t:0 "Violence Reaches the Political Theatre"
wcc.21.d:0 "For some time the violence has been mostly between the supporters of the radical parties, however recently the violence is now reaching the candidates and politicians themselves. Failed attempts on the lives of both Huey Long and Jack Reed have occurred in the past few months. Both gunmen shooting from a crowd, both failed, and both resulted in higher security. Several more local politicians have been stabbed during a campaign rally. Moreover, voters from both extremes are turning a blind eye to the violence done to their enemies."
wcc.21.a:0 "Great, more violence."

wcc.22.t:0 "May Day Riots"
wcc.22.d:0 "May Day, International Workers day, this is a holiday that the Socialist Party celebrates with numerous parades and speeches and has since its founding. Generally, things are peaceful, though there have been confrontations with the police. However this time things are more violent than normal. Clashes between the Socialists and the local police backed up by the AFP have occurred around the country. The question is who is at fault? The Socialists declare that things were peaceful till the police and the Ku Klux Klan arrived on the scene. The Old Democrats are saying that the Socialists began by assaulting ununionized workers, and have blurry photos they claim are guns the SPA were brandishing."
wcc.22.a:0 "The SPA were at fault."
wcc.22.b:0 "The police were at fault."

wcc.23.t:0 "Saint Patrick's Day Flood"
wcc.23.d:0 "On March 16, 1936, warmer than usual temperatures led to the melting of large amounts of snow and ice on the upper Allegheny and Monongahela rivers. The rivers and their tributaries had already overflowed their banks and were soon threatening the city of Pittsburgh. On March 17, 1936, the waters reached the flood stage of twenty-five feet. Then, overnight, heavy rain caused the water to rise even higher, and on March 18, the water peaked at about forty-six feet, twenty-one feet above the flood stage.\n\nThis is the worst such disaster in the city's history, and local authorities have already requested federal aid."
wcc.23.a:0 "We must help the people."
wcc.23.b:0 "They will have to help themselves."

wcc.24.t:0 "Red Summer"
wcc.24.d:0 "The summer heat has turned into violence and blood as cities, starting with Charleston, South Carolina, throughout the country engaged in bloody racial riots as whites beat up blacks and burned black businesses. The number of lynchings that occurred throughout the country spiked during the summer. In response, The African Blood Brotherhood and other elements of the SPA and CSA have begun arming and fighting back. The Socialist Party of America have defended their actions, and have furnished blurry photos they claim show Old Democrat members in lynch mobs."

wcc.27.t:0 "Crime Spree Sweeps the Nation"
wcc.27.d:0 "As America spirals ever deeper into chaos, there has been a wave of crime throughout the country. Many of these criminals are getting sensationalist news stories about their activities, especially gangsters like John Dillinger and the scandalous Bonnie & Clyde. Thankfully the Bureau of Investigation has been working hard to catch these criminals and bring some order back to America. Of course, the AFP and SPA have begun attributing these crimes to moral decline and robber baronies respectively."
wcc.27.a:0 "Stop right there criminal scum!"

wcc.28.t:0 "Paramilitary Militias forming"
wcc.28.d:0 "With violence and instability sweeping the country, the AFP and SPA have begun growing their existing paramilitary militias, which they claim are necessary to protect their supporters from either the government, vigilantes associated with the Old Democrats or even each other. The AFP have called their group 'the Minutemen', while the SPA's 'the Red Guard'. Meanwhile the Old Democrats are associated with various white supremacist paramilitary groups especially a revanchist national Klan whose growth was a result of as a reaction to "immigrant radicalism", minority demands for civil rights representation under Palmer and the new leadership methods of Samuel Green whom made the Klan "respectable" again after the resignation of Hiram Wesley Evans, granting more autonomy to local Klan chapters, having disgraced former Klan leader while encouraging them to defend the Old Democrats. Seen patrolling their strongholds and party rallies, these well-armed and equipped paramilitary units have already engaged in scattered, though extremely violent conflicts. We believe the paramilitaries are modifying civilian firearms, and the FBI's attempts to seize weapon stockpiles are too slow to stop gun runners. This could turn very bad, very fast."

wcc.29.t:0 "More Old Democrats announcing Congressional bids"
wcc.29.d:0 "While there have been a number of lawmakers from the Old Democrats in its brief life, particularly in the South, the 1936 election represents an unprecedented number of people registering to run for office under the banner of the Old Democrats and just as many, if not more nationwide, pledging to vote for them. A political faction with an ambigious relationship to the Democratic Party they appear to primary Democrats they disapprove of whenever possible and when it's not they run on their own ticket. When they win they nonetheless caucus with the Democrats whom often dislike them but need their support."

Now, in July, the heat has reached all-time records. In Steele, North Dakota, temperatures have reached 121°F (50°C). In Ohio, temperatures have reached 110°F (43°C), which was close to tying a record high set in 1934.\n\nThis comes in a time of major political unrest, with the America First Council a major force in Midwest Politics, and Socialist and Syndicalist forces gathering strength in the Great Lakes region. The drought is continuing, and over 3,000 reported deaths have been linked to it. Many people are suffering from heat stroke and heat exhaustion. Farmers across the continent saw their worst harvest on record, causing corn and wheat prices to skyrocket, and this heat wave does not seem to be giving up any time soon."

It is clear he wishes to become Kingmaker in our divided congress and views the election of an anti-establishment party as his opening. The Old Democrats fervently hate Long for his opposition to 'old money' and his local battle for power with the Klan despite him attempting to keep this quiet."
wcc.hl1.a:0 "Bastard"

wcc.37.t:0 "Old Democrats denounce SPA!"
wcc.37.d:0 "The Old Democrats have contested the results of the election. They claim that Reed's allies have rigged the election and demanded a recount. William H. Murray even gave a mocking speech accepting the Presidency to his followers. Some murmurs from inside the AFP have reported that the Republicans and Democrats that left for the AFP have expressed regret for losing this historic election."

wcc.39.t:0 "President Hoover Supports New President"
wcc.39.d:0 "Herbert Hoover broke personal political lines to throw his support behind the incoming president, [WCC.GetLeader]. Hoover stated that only adherence to the word of the law could bring the country together in these tough times. [WCC.GetLeader] in turn has thanked Hoover for his service to his country."

wcc.40.t:0 "The New Year’s Day Strike"
wcc.40.d:0 "In protest of the election results, the SPA has launched a strike on New Year’s Day which has crippled the industries of the north. Councils of Trade Unions and Councils of Professional Workers have been set up to run the cities of the Steel Belt during the strike. The Hearst newspapers have demonised this to be similar to the general strike that set off the British Revolution."

wcc.41.d:0 "The country's social problems have forced the American people to turn to radical solutions; the two-party system has broken down, and Jack Reed is to be sworn in as the 31st president of the United States with Norman Thomas being sworn in as the Vice President. In a stirring speech in Washington DC, Reed has pledged to defend the interests of the workers and work to help revolutionize society for the good of all Americans. However, the SPA's slim majority in Congress means that it may find it challenging to pass meaningful legislation, especially in the Senate, where the AFP has promised to filibuster any law it sees as detrimental to America."
wcc.41.a:0 "Let the People rejoice!"

wcc.42.t:0 "Executive Order 7080: Labor Unions"
wcc.42.d:0 "One of Reed's first acts as president to enshrine the rights to collectively bargain in law. Unwilling to wait to overcome the Senate filibuster, and citing the violent conflict between reactionary and SPA paramilitaries, Reed passed an executive order that forced state and federal governments to recognize a union's right to exist and engage in collective bargaining, without exception, thus forbidding Yellow Dog contracts. While the unions rejoice, many in the country denounce the executive order as a tyrannical act of the Executive Branch."
wcc.42.a:0 "For The Union Makes Us Strong!"

wcc.43.t:0 "The Bourgeoisie are Furious."
wcc.43.d:0 "From New York to San Francisco, the rich and powerful protested Reed's election in the Hearst newspapers and in Congressional addresses. However his strongest foes are amongst the Old Democrats and their paramilitary affiliates. It is clear that the upper class is furious at the enforcement of Executive Order 7080, and have begun to radicalize against the SPA as a result."
wcc.43.a:0 "Let reactionaries shout"

wcc.44.t:0 "Opposition Denounces Reed as Tyrant"
wcc.44.d:0 "Though they agreed on little else, the Democrats, Republicans, and the America First Parties have been quick to denounce Reed publicly across the nation for the enactment of Executive Order 7080, claiming that it to be an overreach of the Executive Branch, and the start of the slide into tyranny. Old Democrat John E. Rankin has gone so far as to have vowed to not follow any law that 'Dictator Reed' imposes upon America. Rankin followed up by comparing President Reed to Vladimir Lenin, almost gloating that Reed would share Lenin's fate."
wcc.44.a:0 "Shut up, Rankin"

wcc.45.t:0 "Executive Order 7089: Halt on Foreclosure"
wcc.45.d:0 "Directing the Secretary of Commerce to Temporarily Take Possession of and Operate the Facilities of Certain Financial Companies\n\nThe inability to deal with the Great Depression had been the death of two major parties, and it would be the death of the SPA as well, unless Reed acted quickly and decisively. Believing that the corrupt financial sector was primarily responsible for creating and prolonging the Depression, Reed has moved to nationalize the banks of Wall Street to force them to act in the public, rather than the private, good. This includes stopping banks from foreclosing on bankrupt homeowners. A filibuster by Senator Roosevelt has forced Reed to resort to an Executive Order, appealing yet again to national security. While popular with the lower classes, many in the upper classes claim Reed is drunk on his power and well on his way to declare himself a dictator."

wcc.46.d:0 "The Supreme Court has allowed the first challenge to Executive Order 7089, Standard Oil of California vs. Paul Mattick, to be heard. This case is brought by Paul Mattick to argue that Standard Oil's monopolistic power has overtaken democratic power. The accusation of Standard Oil bribing the Boston City Council is being taken very seriously. The nation waits to see if Reed's power will be checked, or whether the SPA will continue to enact their agenda in defiance of the Senate."

wcc.47.d:0 "Directing the Secretary of the Interior to Temporarily Take Possession of and Operate the Facilities of Certain Mining Companies\n\nThe belief that public land was a public good is essential to most left-leaning parties, and the flagrant abuse of public land by mining companies had long been a source of deep bitterness for the transcendantalists. To most of Reed's cabinet, it was clear that private mining companies would be entirely unable to balance the needs of the public with their greed, and moved to nationalize the drilling and mining companies, included Standard Oil, whose case against Executive Order 7089 was still pending. This has been seen by many as an attack against a political rival, and further confirmation that Reed wishes to turn America into a syndicalist state like the Commune of France or the Union of Britain."
wcc.47.a:0 "America's Resources belong to the People!"

wcc.48.t:0 "Packing the Court"
wcc.48.d:0 "Although Reed has shown no sign of concern over Standard Oil vs. Paul Mattick in public, his administration is concerned that the conservative-leaning Supreme Court could rule 7-2 in favour of the capitalists, and revert whatever reforms had already been put in place. Citing Lincoln's court-packing during the Civil War as precedent, Reed has asked Senate Majority Leader Meyer London to remove the filibuster for judicial appointees, and has increased the size of the Supreme Court to 15. It is clear that he intends to appoint 6 pro-socialist justices to the bench, which will ensure his Executive Orders will remain constitutional. This has provoked a firestorm of protest, even from the left-leaning Farmer-Labor and Progressive parties, which had up until now remained neutral or supportive of Reed."
wcc.48.a:0 "We must defend the workers, whatever it takes"

wcc.49.t:0 "Violence Against the SPA Spreads"
wcc.49.d:0 "In the immediate aftermath of Reed's court-packing, Murray has come out aggressively against Reed, all but calling for an armed uprising. Whole counties and states, especially in the south, are refusing to accept Reed's Executive Orders as law, and there has been a massive increase in reported violent clashes between the Minutemen, Klan and SPA militia. Unless order is restored, the country is bound for a civil war."
wcc.49.a:0 "The police should be helping the people!"

wcc.50.t:0 "Clashes Between National Klan and Police"
wcc.50.d:0 "The Old Democrats calls for a resistance against Reed have been interpreted by some as a call for resistance against any governmental agency. Police clashes with Long's Minutemen have now become common throughout the country. In cities with strong SPA presence, members of the General Defense Committees helped the police restore law and order, but in the Deep South, the Old Democrat paramilitaries effectively have complete control."
wcc.50.a:0 "Somebody Stop Them!"

wcc.51.t:0 "MacArthur Marches onto Washington"
wcc.51.d:0 "Reed's support in D.C has finally bottomed out. General Douglas MacArthur has marched into Washington D.C today, to arrest Reed and his cabinet at the White House. MacArthur's marchers reminded many in D.C of Cox's Army of 1932, except these men are motivated to preserve the status quo, and were cheered instead of booed. Having been tipped off by SPA informants in MacArthur's command staff, Reed was able to stay ahead of the traitorous general and has escaped to Chicago. MacArthur has chosen to inhabit the White House and coordinate an investigation into Reed from the executive chair. Civil war is imminent."

wcc.52.d:0 "The country's social problems have forced the American people to turn to radical solutions; the two-party system has broken down, and Huey P. Long is to be sworn in as the 31st president of the United States with William Lemke being sworn in as the Vice President with the support of progressives giving him just enough support to take Congress. In a stirring speech in Washington DC, Long has pledged to defend the interest of the people and to put the interest of the regular American above anyone else. However, the AFP's slim coalition in Congress means that it may find it challenging to pass meaningful legislation, especially in the senate where an assortment of Old Democratic, Republican and SPA senators have promised to filibuster any law they see as detrimental to America."
wcc.52.a:0 "God Bless America."

wcc.53.t:0 "Executive Order 7037: Farm Aid Bill"
wcc.53.d:0 "One of Long's first acts was to provide relief for the farmers of America, thus this executive order directed the Secretary of Commerce. The order enforces price controls on farm products, provides credit to the farmers and provide tariffs on grains and other cereals. This will reverse the price slump that is driving farmers into poverty. Unwilling to wait to overcome the Senate filibuster, and citing the violent conflict that is going on in America, Long passed the executive order bypassing Congress entirely. While farmers across the country rejoice, many in the country denounce the Executive Order as a tyrannical act of the Executive Branch."
wcc.53.a:0 "Approved"

wcc.54.t:0 "Wealth And Fear Go Hand in Hand"
wcc.54.d:0 "From New York to San Francisco the rich and powerful protested Long's election in the Hearst newspapers and in Congressional addresses. It is clear that the wealthy whether politically minded or not are furious at the reforms Huey Long is passing, as well as his opposition to free market policies passed under Hoover. This has trickled down to the middle class readers, who are beginning to radicalize in favor of the Old Democrats."

Opponents have gone so far as to disobey any law that 'King Long' wishes to impose upon America. Jack Reed has even stepped up to the podium to call Huey Long 'the American Codreanu' and waves around folders of recorded hate crimes committed by President Long's followers."
wcc.55.a:0 "Those men don't represent me!"

wcc.56.t:0 "Executive Order 7048: Share Our Wealth"
wcc.56.d:0 "By virtue of the authority vested in me, I, Huey Pierce Long, President of the United States of America, do declare the intrinsic right of the poor to have relief. A new government agency will be created to mete out the basic needs of every American, so that our nation's great wealth is felt not only in the upper echelons of power but also in the lowest hovel. Also included with the executive order is a wide array of tax increases on the wealthiest Americans. While incredibly popular with the AFP's base, and hardly unexpected considering Long's 'Share the Wealth' slogan, many Americans are protesting what appears to be a massive overstep of the executive power of the president. The constitutionality of increasing taxes by fiat, and how this new agency would even manage to operate, are questions that has thrown the government into immediate chaos and confusion. Long has already begun campaigning hard, using press releases to rail against the 'corporate order' which would see America fall to syndicalist rhetoric."
wcc.56.a:0 "Sharing our wealth is our only defense!"

wcc.57.t:0 "Executive Order 7048 declared Unconstitutional"
wcc.57.d:0 "In a highly publicized court case, Chief Justice Charles Evan Hughes has declared that executive order 7048 is unconstitutional. This was a narrow court case and was split 5-4 against the president. When news reached the White House, Long fumed at the news that the court would block the necessary reforms needed to ensure the safety of America."
wcc.57.a:0 "Charles Hughes has made his decision, now let him enforce it!"

wcc.58.t:0 "Packing the Court"
wcc.58.d:0 "The decision by the Supreme Court to declare his executive order unconstitutional has made Long take an extra-legal solution. Citing Lincoln's court-packing during the Civil War as precedent, Long has asked the Senate Majority Leader to remove the filibuster for Judicial appointees, and has increased the size of the Supreme Court to 15. It is clear that Long intends to appoint 6 pro-AFP justices to the branch that shall ensure that his executive orders will be constitutional. This has provoked a firestorm of protest throughout the country, even from the members of Congress that have so far remained neutral or supportive of Long."
wcc.58.a:0 "I shall defend the interests of the nation"

wcc.59.t:0 "Executive Order 7050: Declare SPA Terrorists"
wcc.59.d:0 "Citing national concerns due to the anarchistic nature of the Socialist Party of America, Huey Long has passed an executive order that has declared them an illegal organization which seeks to overthrow the country, and as such all force shall be used to oppose them. Long has drawn a direct comparison between the SPA militias and the terrorist attacks that occured on Preparedness Day in 1916, and Wall Street in 1920. The militias are now subject to the Sedition Act of 1918, prosecuted as an anti-recruitment and vigilante group."
wcc.59.a:0 "Excellent!"

wcc.60.t:0 "Reed Defies the Order"
wcc.60.d:0 "Jack Reed publicly denounced the Order as being unconstitutional and an act that would provoke the country's workers against Long. Reed has organized large rallies and protests against them with the Red Guard there to keep the workers safe from the Minutemen. These highly reported on protests have seen union scabs beaten without interference from the police, which calls into question Long's ability to protect Americans."
wcc.60.a:0 "Rely on the police to keep control"

wcc.61.t:0 "Union Workers and Police Clash"
wcc.61.d:0 "In an unexpected move, the police have refused to enforce the various executive orders. Within Chicago, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, and other cities scattered throughout the Steel Belt, they have declared a Police Strike in solidarity with the workers. While they worked to keep order, Police union leaders publicly declare that they would not follow the Laws of 'King Long'. Thus Long called in the US Army to enforce his laws."
wcc.61.a:0 "Send in the big boys"

wcc.62.t:0 "The Minutemen clash with the SPA"
wcc.62.d:0 "When the Minutemen arrived in the Steel Belt to enforce the laws of the President, they were immediately set upon by members of the SPA and its supporters. Shoot-outs quickly became commonplace, and the violence quickly spread throughout almost every major city in the Steel Belt. It has quickly noticed that the governmnet has no remaining authority within the Steel Belt."

### President Curtis ###

wcc.64.t:0 "Charles Curtis' Inauguration"
wcc.64.d:0 "After his election, Curtis addressed the nation. Curtis called for patience and civility in these difficult times. Curtis was quoted as saying 'A nation cannot be preserved which does not preserve its citizens. Industry is reducing wages, lowering the standard of living, destroying buying power, this cannot be the way we solve our economic problems.' Reinvigorated with his unlikely victory, Curtis boldly strides into the White House amidst protests from both the socialists and hard liners with the promise of fixing the economy, restoring national brotherhood, and preventing political violence by any means necessary. Whether the rest of the nation would listen to the message was another story."
wcc.64.a:0 "America is One Nation Indivisible!"

wcc.65.t:0 "Curtis Announces Negotiations"
wcc.65.d:0 "President Curtis has announced that his first priority as president is to end the strike launched by the SPA, and that he has sent an invitation to sit down with Jack Reed in Chicago to negotiate. Reed holds a firm grip over both the IWW and AFL, whom make up the bulk of the general strikers. Our negotiators believe that Curtis's cabinet members are opposed to the talks, seeing any negotiation as political suicide - the coalition was formed, after all, in order to bypass having to directly deal with the SPA, but President Curtis is determined."
wcc.65.a:0 "This is the only way"

wcc.66.t:0 "Reed Accepts Invitation"
wcc.66.d:0 "Jack Reed has sent word to the government that he has accepted the invitation to negotiate. An FBI intelligence file on Reed indicates that, should Reed fail in negotiation, the leaders of the AFL are likely to leave the general strike and defect from the SPA. While preparations are being made in Chicago to heighten security, members of Curtis's cabinet as well as General Douglas MacArthur have expressed their serious misgivings at the entire endeavour. They say President Curtis is putting his life in jeopardy, but for now they will wait to see what comes of the meeting."
wcc.66.a:0 "I survived cancer, I can handle this"

wcc.67.t:0 "Negotiations Begin"
wcc.67.d:0 "Curtis gave a stirring speech stating his plan before the negotiations. 'Today we are endeavoring to save the system we call Capitalism, by attempting to curb selfish individualism, and the avaricious profit motive. That there will be anything left of the so-called capitalistic system, is very doubtful. That there will be great change is certain.' President Curtis and Jack Reed have sat down for their historic meeting in Chicago. though before the meeting can even begin word has arrived that Huey Long has demanded America First be involved in the negotiations. The presence of Long in the meeting will undoubtedly make negotiations more difficult, possibly scuttling them entirely, but refusing Long could incite his supporters in the south and make success in Chicago worthless."
wcc.67.a:0 "Allow Long to participate"
wcc.67.b:0 "Allow Both to participate"
wcc.67.c:0 "Neither has business here"

wcc.68.t:0 "Reed Demands SPA take Social Security"
wcc.68.d:0 "After several days of negotiations, President Curtis and Jack Reed have come to terms. In order for Reed to call off the strike, he wants to see Congress immediately pass bills mandating a livable minimum wage, a maximum 40-hour work week, and a federally-funded welfare system directly under the SPA's administration. He fell short of demanding trade unions be required to have a percentage of seats reserved in Congress, but only reluctantly. Even so, Curtis believes the bill will be a hard sell in Capitol Hill. It is, however, likely the only way to avoid further conflict."
wcc.68.a:0 "We'll see how Congress feels about this"
wcc.68.b:0 "Reed needs to make a better offer"

wcc.69.t:0 "Old Democrats Declares Curtis a Traitor"
wcc.69.d:0 "As President Curtis took Reed's proposal before Congress, William H. Murray and the Old Democrats declared him a traitor to the American people for selling out Social Security to the SPA. AFP Senators also walked out, refusing to listen to Curtis's impassioned plea that they compromise for the sake of peace. Those who remained listened uneasily, and as debate began it quickly became clear that the coalition would not hold in the face of socialist reforms. SPA Senators abandoned Congress, with Jack Reed declaring Curtis's offer worthless and his government too corrupt and dysfunctional to ever serve the American people."
wcc.69.a:0 "We tried, Dear America"

wcc.70.t:0 "Long and Reed Argue"
wcc.70.d:0 "As the meeting in Chicago began in earnest, it quickly became clear that Huey Long and Jack Reed were not going to find middle ground. Both men had contradictory views, and this led to heated arguments. It is apparent from the proceedings that Reed and Long's control over their parties were waning, as both made frequent breaks to confer with their team. President Curtis did his best to keep things civil, but Long and Reed could agree on nothing. Long pushed back at the every measure Reed brought up, save for social security. Jack Reed has threatened to leave the negotiations if Long is not removed."
wcc.70.a:0 "Remove Long from the meeting"
wcc.70.b:0 "Try to work with both the men"

wcc.71.t:0 "Long Ejected from Negotiations"
wcc.71.d:0 "President Curtis called for Huey Long to be physically removed - which was necessary, since the man refused to leave peacefully. Moments later, Long forced his way back into the meeting hall and accused Curtis of selling out Social Security to the syndicates. In a fever pitch, Long began reciting anti-capitalist quotes Curtis had made during his tenure as Governor of Minnesota. The president had little choice but to have security forces drag Long from the building, kicking and screaming, shouting that America would not stand for this treachery."
wcc.71.a:0 "Nobody can negotiate in that state"

wcc.72.t:0 "Minutemen Attack the SPA in Chicago"
wcc.72.d:0 "After Huey Long was forcibly removed from the negotiations, Minutemen attacked members of the SPA party in the street just outside the building. An impromptu battle erupted as armed Minutemen clashed with Red Guard and Federal forces. Fearing for his safety, and more than a little suspicious this was all simply a ruse to see him assassinated and blame placed on the AFP, Jack Reed fled the building... followed shortly by President Curtis, who was taken to Washington out of security concerns. The negotiations have ended in disastrous failure."
wcc.72.a:0 "Long has ruined peace!"

wcc.73.t:0 "The Compromise: Autonomous Administration"
wcc.73.d:0 "After even more long days of talks between President Curtis and Jack Reed, during which several times the entire SPA delegation almost up and left the negotiations, a further compromise has been reached - one the SPA say they will not budge further upon. They have given way on SPA administration over the welfare system, but in return want federal funding for a new organization... including a national board acting as liason between unions and the government, one which the SPA *would* be in control of. This new liason would be named the National Labor Board, or NLB for short. Negotiators feel this package could pass Congress, but not without inciting AFP rage and potentially undoing all efforts to contain them in the South. The only possible way around that, according to advisors, is to bring Long and the AFP into negotiations now and get them on board prior to going public."
wcc.73.a:0 "Present this before Congress now"
wcc.73.b:0 "Bring in Long - we need the AFP's support"

wcc.74.t:0 "NLB Bill Narrowly Approved"
wcc.74.d:0 "In an emergency session of Congress, President Curtis - with Jack Reed beside him - presented the compromise bill for the NLRB before the gathered Senators. He made an impassioned plea, saying that he did not seek a full ratification. That could come in the months ahead. What he needed was a vote indicating that the larger goals in the bill were acceptable to Congress, as a message to the strikers that the federal government intended to act in good faith. While every Conservative Democratic Senator left the building in outrage, refusing to take part in what they declared a 'surrender to syndicalism', Curtis's plea that the coalition hold and consider the need for peace had its intended effet: at five minutes to midnight, the Senate narrowly passed a motion of approval. Jack Reed, greatly relieved, said the SPA would now relay the good news to strikers... then the real talks could begin."
wcc.74.a:0 "A sane, democratic change"

wcc.75.t:0 "AFP Rejects the Compromise"
wcc.75.d:0 "As expected, Huey Long has gone on a rampage the moment news of the compromise went public. He has declared Curtis to be in league with Reed, the government to have failed in its mission to guard the United States against syndicalist interests, and that America's very soul was in jeopardy. While government officials attempted to urge calm, Long's words have struck a chord across the South, firing up AFP support and - as advisors had warned the President - undoing previous efforts to contain them."
wcc.75.a:0 "If Long wants a fight, he's got one"

wcc.76.t:0 "Negotiations Reach Impasse"
wcc.76.d:0 "Huey Long and the AFP gladly accepted the President's invitation to come to the negotiating table, though they were less than pleased once presented with the proposed reforms. After several days of debate, the effort largely seems to have been for naught. Jack Reed and Huey Long argue incessantly on key points of the compromise, and Long's default position is one of hostility towards what he felt as a united front against him. Still, there are points in common between the AFP's and SPA's position, and as the days wear on President Curtis begins to become hopeful there may be signs of Long's resistance slowly wearing down. For the sake of peace, could he be persuaded to accept the terms?"
wcc.76.a:0 "We only need a few more days..."

### President Curtis - Peace ###
wcc.peace1.t:0 "Old Democrats Infuriated"
wcc.peace1.d:0 "The Old Democrats are infuriated at the negotiations going on between Curtis, Long and Reed. They demand to have representatives present, namely William H. Murray and John E. Rankin. Curtis is well aware that inviting them would spell disaster for peace but so would not doing so. Caught between a rock and hard place he believes the best possible course of action may be to agree to see them separately and in the meantime reassure them the negotiations will not apply to the Deep South. Finally, we can follow MacArthur's urging to occupy their regions with federal forces and crackdown on the National Klan."
wcc.peace1.a:0 "Invite them"

wcc.peace2.t:0 "MacArthur worried by agreements"
wcc.peace2.a:0 "MacArthur and military leadership are concerned that the negotiations are simply giving political radicals more time to recruit and organize their paramilitaries while subverting the Constitution. Curtis has attempted to reassure him that this is the only way to peace and that American values will be protected but MacArthur demands to be put in charge of the general staff to ensure this is the case. While Curtis does not care for a military official implicitly threatening a United States President for increased power he must reach a decision."
wcc.peace2.a:0 "Very Well"
wcc.peace2.b:0 "It Would be Undemocratic to Cave in"

wcc.peace3.t:0 "Long and Reed reach agreement"
wcc.peace3.d:0 "Long and Reed have finally reached an agreement that their respective movements will be allowed a larger amount of control over fiscal and labor relations in their respective regions alongside federally funded welfare programs. While neither got what the completely wanted both have left satisfied bragging about their victory to their respective supporters clearly intoxicated by their increased power and hopes of winning the 1940 election. Now is the issue of the Old Democrats. We could invite them to the meeting to apply greater autonomy to their region, simply ignore them or as MacArthur urges us occupy their regions with federal forces now."
wcc.peace3.a:0 "Invite them"
wcc.peace3.b:0 "Ignore them"
wcc.peace3.c:0 "Occupy them"

wcc.peace4.t:0 "Hoover's Dirt"
wcc.peace4.d:0 "Our occupation of the South has not been easy, with the Old Democrats resisting us and the National Klan denouncing us as traitors. Nonetheless occupation has prevented an outright uprising for the moment but it is clear that without the Klan losing support through other means we can not finish the job or hold on forever. Today however J. Edgar Hoover has alerted us that he has evidence of Indiana Klan Leader D.C. Stephenson's corruption, which includes him and his circle engaging in alcohol, drugs, intimidation, 'relations' with minors, sexual assault, and murder. While it is unclear why Hoover kept this information to himself unless he was hedging a bets to use this information as a bargaining chip in case of an Old Democrat or non-establishment victory is unclear but despite Curtis' disgust with Hoover for not pursuing this earlier it is obvious publishing this and bringing Stephenson to court could discredit the Klan."
wcc.peace4.a:0 "Wait on it"
wcc.peace4.b:0 "Arrest Stephenson"

wcc.peace5.t:0 "Klan disgraced"
wcc.peace5.d:0 "The news of Stephenson's misdeeds have reached the nation, with even Old Democrats unsure whether to call them lies or distance themselves as well. Nonetheless entire Klan chapters are leaving en masse in many areas of the West and North and their membership is draining even in the South. This has made occupation far more viable rather than a short-term solution."

wcc.peace6.t:0 "Ending the Occupation?"
wcc.peace6.d:0 "Socialists would have us occupy the South perpetually but that simply isn't possible. We could pull our troops out now that the Klan has been discredited and the Old Democrats weakened so as to not make them martyr's."

wcc.77.t:0 "MacArthur and the Army Remove Curtis"
wcc.77.d:0 "It appears Curtis's time has run out. With the perception outside the Chicago meeting being that it is dragging on for too long, while the AFP and SPA continue to garner power, Curtis's own cabinet has lost its confidence that any resolution would be reached. With the cabinet's apparent co-operation, General Douglas MacArthur took charge of an emergency administration intended to 'preserve the country from extremist forces, before it's too late'. Jack Reed and Huey Long have fled the Chicago meeting, both believing they have been utterly betrayed that the federal government would act while their guard was down. While the government is attempting to reassure the American public that all is under control, most are looking on in shock. Civil war appears imminent."
wcc.77.a:0 "So it has come to this"

wcc.78.t:0 "President Announces Hard Line"
wcc.78.d:0 "President [WCC.GetLeader] today announced that a hard line would be taken against the SPA strikers, and indeed against any extremist force that seeks to further destablize America. Executive Orders have been issues to curb the ability of the America First Party and the Socialist Party of America to operate, this despite protests from Senators in both parties. All SPA and AFP Senators walked out of Capitol Hill, to the jeers of their Republican and Democratic colleagues, thus adding to the sense that the country was nearing a political breaking point."
wcc.78.a:0 "We will restore order, no matter what"

wcc.79.t:0 "Reed Condemns Police Violence"
wcc.79.d:0 "As the SPA strike continues, spreading outside of the Steel Belt, clashes between strikers and the police have becomes more common. Jack Reed has urged the AFL and IWW strikers to resist without violence, but this hasn't always worked - especially when the strikers are simultaneously provoked by America First supporters. Reed has publicly condemned the government for adding to the violence, rather than protecting those who need it most. 'What these workers need are jobs that don't exploit them, that don't sacrifice their flesh and blood upon the altar of American Greed," Reed declared in a Minneapolis speech. 'What they get instead is a government that acts at the behast of their capitalist overlords.'"
wcc.79.a:0 "We're trying to keep order!"

wcc.80.t:0 "Long Declares War On Tyranny"
wcc.80.d:0 "The SPA strikers aren't the only ones feeling the heat at the hands of American police. So, too, have the Minutemen come under increased scrutiny. Several Minutemen training centers in Alabama and South Carolina were raided by police in recent days, and AFP meetings have been constantly harrassed - or so Huey Long has loudly complained. 'The federal government has opted for open tyranny,' he said. 'They will do anything to keep us down, when what we seek is a government that is worthy of us!' His recent speech in Charlotte was received by cheering crowds, indicative of the AFP's growing influence."
wcc.80.a:0 "We'll see about that!"

wcc.81.t:0 "The General Strike Spreads"
wcc.81.d:0 "The SPA's general strike has spread far and wide, all but bringing the nation to a standstill in many industrial states. The city of St. Louis in particular has become a warzone, day to day life all but ended as strikers clash variously either with Federal forces or with AFP Minutemen. The sense of chaos has led to several riots as protests by regular citizens have turned into looting and civil unrest. People are leaving St. Louis by the thousands, and are calling for immediate government intervention."
wcc.81.a:0 "It is coming!"

wcc.82.t:0 "Tension in the Steel Belt"
wcc.82.d:0 "As National Guardsmen arrive in the north to end the SPA strike, tensions remain high. Many of the various mayors and even governors were not just supportive of the strike but actively helping it. Consequently, they strongly oppose the use of the National Guard. The strikers have begun to taunt the guards, and have even assaulted scab workers brought into the factories under National Guard escort. It is clear a single spark can set off the entire American north. President [WCC.GetLeader] remains undeterred by this, and declared on the radio that the general strike must end for the good of the nation, with the unsaid implication that force will be used if it doesn't."
wcc.82.a:0 "Force is necessary now"

wcc.83.t:0 "Clashes in the South"
wcc.83.d:0 "National Guard units today fought with Minutemen militia in northern Louisiana, a raid that soon turned into a bloodbath as Minutemen opened fire. In the end, over fourty Guardsmen were killed as well as an unknown number of Minutemen. Huey Long and the AFP denied involvement with the militia, but questioned the presence of the National Guard in what should clearly have been a police matter. The militia, they claim, were merely defending themselves. Photos of the ensuing bloody scene have circulated in southern newspapers, resulting in a new wave of outrage from the public directed at the federal government."
wcc.83.a:0 "But not at the Minutemen? Not even a little?"

wcc.84.t:0 "The Pittsburgh Massacre"
wcc.84.d:0 "All it took was a single spark to start the revolution, and in Pittsburgh that spark occurred when a crowd of people stood outside one factory determined to oppose the National Guard. Guardsmen fired into the crowd leaving five dead. It did not take long for this to quickly be dubbed the 'Pittsburgh Massacre' and the Steel Belt was driven into a frenzy. Soon National Guardsmen and police were fighting with SPA militia throughout the Steel Belt. Newspapers across the country have 'civil war' splashed across their headlines, and public panic is at a crescendo."
wcc.84.a:0 "What next?"

wcc.85.t:0 "J. Edgar Hoover's Proposal"
wcc.85.d:0 "J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the FBI, arrived at the White House early today to grimly inform President [WCC.GetLeader] that civil war is imminent. The best chance for the federal government, he says, is to take decisive action now before the AFP and SPA can become more organized. An assassination of Huey Long would mean the collapse of the AFP, as it centered around his personality. An assassination of Jack Reed, meanwhile, would throw the SPA into disarray while the IWW and AFL competed for leadership... at least long enough for the immediate danger to pass. There would be consequences, Hoover advises, not least of all the rightful suspicion that would fall on a democratic government for taking such an extreme act... but these are desperate times. If the FBI is to act, Hoover says, they must act now, for there is only time for one operation."
wcc.85.a:0 "Take out Jack Reed and the SPA"
wcc.85.b:0 "Take out Huey Long and the AFP"
wcc.85.c:0 "We will not stoop to such undemocratic measures"

wcc.87.t:0 "Huey Long Assassinated!"
wcc.87.d:0 "Just outside the Lousiana state legislature in Louisiana, Huey Long - leader of the America First Party and prominent critic of the United States federal government - was shot to death by an assailant who, in turn, was killed by Long's bodyguards. The motives of the assassination are unknown, but while many are ascribing it to the Socialist Party of America the SPA's leader, Jack Reed, has hotly denied any involvement and instead is pointing the finger at the federal government and President [WCC.GetLeader]... a version of events which is gaining widespread acceptance in the country, increasing the anger towards an already-troubled government. The former Democrats within the AFP have silently deserted the more radical elements of the party, and the FBI reports that neither William Lemke nor Charles Coughlin have been able to meet with the AFP Congressmen."
wcc.87.a:0 "That's it for the AFP, at least"
wcc.87.b:0 "Interesting"

wcc.88.t:0 "Jack Reed Assassinated!"
wcc.88.d:0 "While returning from a meeting at the Indiana state legislature, Jack Reed - leader of the Socialist Party of America and head of the ICC - was shot to death by an unknown assailant. A manhunt is currently underway for the sniper, even as workers across America mourn his loss. While many are ascribing the deed to the America First Party, the AFP's leader, Huey Long, has hotly denied any involvement and instead is pointing the finger at President [WCC.GetLeader]... a version of events which is gaining widespread acceptance in the country, increasing the anger towards an already-troubled government. The labour leaders from the AFL have declared Reed's strike to be wildcat, and therefore have ordered their unions to return to work. The IWW has responded by declaring the AFL scabs, and it appears their brief cooperation has ended."
wcc.88.a:0 "That's it for the SPA, at least"
wcc.88.b:0 "Interesting"

wcc.89.t:0 "Reed Accuses the Government of Murder"
wcc.89.d:0 "With the country still reeling from Huey Long's death, and the AFP collapsing, Jack Reed has been quick to capitalise on the growing public anger. At a recent rally in Detroit, Reed all but accused the government of murder. 'I won't say that I agreed with Huey,' he said, 'but he wanted the life of the average American to be better. He wanted a government that was better, that stood for us all. What we have now is a government that stands only for capitalist greed, a cancer growing within the heart of American democracy which will kill anything that tries to cut it out.' Demonstrations across the country have echoed Reed's words, particularly in the South where Long's supporters have begun a campaign of violence against government targets, and it seems things will quickly get worse."
wcc.89.a:0 "We must brace for impact"

wcc.90.t:0 "Long Accuses the Feds of Murder"
wcc.90.d:0 "With the country still reeling from Jack Reed's death, and the SPA caught up in in-fighting to determine his rightful successor, Huey Long has been quick to capitalise on the growing public anger. At a recent rally in Alabama, Long all but accused the government of murder. 'We have been spared a devil who would have led us down the road to tyranny,' he said, 'but we must face another kind of tyranny in our own government. American democracy is dead, and it is President [WCC.GetLeader] who has killed it. We must rise up and meet steel with steel, guns with guns!' Demonstrations across the country have echoed Long's words, particularly in the Steel Belt where SPA supporters have lashed out against government targets en masse, and it seems things will quickly get worse."
wcc.90.a:0 "We must brace for impact"


### Garner Path ###

wcc.91.t:0 "John N. Garner's Inauguration"
wcc.91.d:0 "Today John Nance Garner has been sworn in as the 31st president of America. Garner's speech spoke about how we must not compromise our democratic values with radicals, left or right. Garner was quoted as saying 'We are in a tough-minded recognition that the fight for a better America is a long one.' On the economy, Garner has promised reform through personal sacrifice and austerity, as was done after the Panic of 1893. Garner enters the White House surrounded by hostile AFP and SPA Senators as well as wary Republicans, though he has assured the public that the Longists and Unionists will tire themselves out before the end of the year."
wcc.91.a:0 "God Save America"

wcc.92.t:0 "The Austerity Bill"
wcc.92.d:0 "President Garner has introduced an Emergency Austerity Measures bill into Congress today, an almost certainly controversial piece of legislation which would see government spending cuts across the board - especially towards the social security net. Garner's speech to the Senate spoke of the sacrifice needed if America is to recover from the Great Depression, and it was met with mostly skepticism and jeers from non-Democratic Senators. Even Garner's own cabinet expressed reservations regarding his choice, suggesting passage of the bill might prove difficult... though, if it can be managed, it would almost certainly save the country."
wcc.92.a:0 "Believe in America"

wcc.93.t:0 "Long Denounces Austerity Measures"
wcc.93.d:0 "As discussions began in Capitol Hill regarding the austerity bill, the AFP immediately denounced it. Huey Long said in a North Carolina speech that austerity did the exact opposite of what was necessary. Rather than sharing the wealth, it took every last bit of wealth from those who needed it most. Austerity, he claims, would leave the average American more desperately poor than they are now, and would leave them vulnerable to syndicalist rhetoric. Long said he would be directing AFP to oppose the bill at every turn, for the sake of the country."
wcc.93.a:0 "We shall see"

wcc.94.t:0 "D.C. Demonstration Turns Violent"
wcc.94.d:0 "A demonstration in Washington D.C. by workers and strikers voicing their disapproval of the austerity measures bill, today turned violent as police attempted to break up the crowd. SPA members present said theirs was a peaceful protest, that police provoked the crowd into a response. Regardless of the cause, the end result was a pitched battle with police that left the city in chaos for two days and left hundreds of protestors injured. SPA leader Jack Reed condemned the police action as brutality and imperialist suppression."
wcc.94.a:0 "We are trying to keep order, Reed!"

wcc.95.t:0 "General Strike Spreads"
wcc.95.d:0 "The SPA's general strike has spread far and wide, all but bringing the nation to a standstill in many industrial states. The city of St. Louis in particular has become a warzone, day to day life all but ended as strikers clash variously either with Federal forces or with AFP Minutemen. The sense of chaos has led to several riots as protests by regular citizens have turned into looting and civil unrest. People are leaving St. Louis by the thousands, calling for immediate government intervention."
wcc.95.a:0 "Damned Fools!"

wcc.96.t:0 "Austerity Bill Voting Commences"
wcc.96.d:0 "Voting on the Emergency Austerity Measures bill began in Congress today, though early indications were not good. While the bill is solidly backed by Democratic Senators, it is rabidly opposed by both the SPA and AFP... and there are enough Republican Senators remaining on the fence, unwilling to be swayed, that passage may prove unlikely without intervention. The president's cabinet is suggesting calling for a meeting of the major party representatives in Philadelphia, to try and work out a compromise - at least enough of one to make passage easier. It is also possible that President Garner could campaign for the votes of influential Republicans. A coalition may not have been in the cards, but perhaps he could appeal to their sense of civic duty on this one instance alone?"
wcc.96.a:0 "Arrange the Philadelphia meeting"
wcc.96.b:0 "Let's campaign for the Republican vote"

wcc.97.t:0 "Philadelphia Meeting Begins"
wcc.97.d:0 "The historic meeting in Philadelphia began today, with all four major political parties present and President Garner appealing to them that a compromise on the austerity bill was necessary for the sake of national peace and prosperity. As the parties talked, however, it quickly became clear that Huey Long and Jack Reed would both absorb most of the attention. Despite the number of Senators they represent, everyone in the room knows very well the influence they hold in the country, and both men disagreed on almost every aspect of compromise. Reed wanted workers protected from cuts to government contracts, while Long wanted to add an Open Shop claue to austerity. While there is evidence that President Garner and Huey Long see eye-to-eye on many issues, it is quickly becoming clear that compromise will be utterly impossible with both men present."
wcc.97.a:0 "Eject Long and the AFP"
wcc.97.b:0 "Eject Reed and the SPA"
wcc.97.c:0 "We will all go together"

wcc.98.t:0 "Long and the AFP Kicked Out"
wcc.98.d:0 "President Garner called for Huey Long to be physically removed - which was necessary, since the man refused to leave peacefully. Moments later, he forced his way back into the meeting hall and accused Garner of throwing out fiscal responsibility for the syndicates' sake. The president had little choice but to have security forces drag Long from the building, kicking and screaming, shouting that America would not stand for this treachery. It was only after he left that the subdued remaining Senators could continue the negotiations."
wcc.98.a:0 "That's a bully right there!"

wcc.99.t:0 "Garner and Long Make Progress"
wcc.99.d:0 "President Garner called for Jack Reed and the SPA to be ejected from the meeting, though before Reed left he made a solemn speech to those present. He accused them of bowing to tyranny, that a government which didn't understand the worker would meet its ultimate fate at the hand of that worker. After his departure, however, things went much more smoothly. Long indicated he was willing to make compromises, so long as amendments to the austerity bill supporting Long's Share Our Wealth Society indirectly through tax breaks. With this, as well as putting Huey Long himself named as the head of a new Unamerican Activities Committee, he could go to his supporters and say that progress was finally being made. There are those present at the meeting, however, who caution that this will undoubtedly infuriate the SPA and make irrelevant any measures the government has undertaken to curb their control in the North."
wcc.99.a:0 "We can finally agree"
wcc.99.b:0 "We will not be blackmailed into such measures!"

wcc.100.t:0 "The Pittsburgh Massacre"
wcc.100.d:0 "Just as the remaining members of the meeting began to make headway, and it was looking as if a compromise on the austerity bill would be reached, word arrived in Philadelphia of a battle taking place in nearby Pittsburgh. SPA strikers had been attacked by Minutemen milita members, a fight which turned bloody when federal forces arrived on the scene and attempted to intervene. Several bombs were detonated, adding to the chaos, and the Senators received reports of unidentified militia forces advancing on Philadelphia. President Garner was evacuated from the building by his security forces, over his objections, and both the meeting and the vote have crumbled to a premature end."
wcc.100.a:0 "It seems the hell fire is upon us"

wcc.101.t:0 "Long and Reed Stall Meeting"
wcc.101.d:0 "While President Garner's attempt to get Huey Long and Jack Reed to come to some kind of agreement was commendable, after several days of debate it appears to have mostly come to naught. Both men are frustrated, and several times each has threatened to walk out of the meeting entirely. It is apparent from the proceedings that Reed and Long's control over their parties were waning, as both made frequent breaks to confer with their team. Republicans are split on the matter, and there are not enough of them who will vote for the bill if they believe the country will erupt into violence anyhow. Both Long and Reed have given a deadline until tomorrow, at which point they say there is no chance of the Philadelphia meeting continuing. The gathered Senators are looking to the president to somehow solve the impasse."
wcc.101.a:0 "What can I do?"

wcc.102.t:0 "Austerity Bill Passes"
wcc.102.d:0 "With the endorsement of the AFP, the Emergency Austerity Measures bill passed - though not before all SPA Senators up and walked out of the chamber in protest. News of the exemptions, as well as the added restrictions on industrial unions and Huey Long's presence at the head of a new committee which will likely see more crackdowns on socialist activity, has fired up SPA supporters across the Steel Belt with outrage. Jack Reed has declared the government a dead and useless body, so corrupt it could not even see Long for the snake he truly is, and says the American worker will never get a fair shake unless he fights for it. Demonstrations have erupted across the northern part of the country - as suspected, making the government's efforts to combat SPA control useless - although, in the South, Long's assurances have gone a long way towards keeping his supporters quiet."
wcc.102.a:0 "If Reed wants a fight, he's got one"

wcc.103.t:0 "Austerity Bill Fails"
wcc.103.d:0 "While President Garner campaigned long and hard into the night, at the end of the day there were simply too few Republican Senators willing to vote for a bill that they didn't have the support of the SPA and AFP, and which would likely result in violence anyhow. Garner's austerity plan is seen as a poor follow up to the Garner-Wagner bill he co-authored in 1934. The entire vote was even delayed by an actual fist-fight between a Republican and a AFP Senator. In the end, the vote failed by a slim margin... though the margin might as well have been a chasm, into which all of President Garner's hopes and aspirations could be tossed."
wcc.103.a:0 "Congress isn't worth piss anyways"

wcc.104.t:0 "MacArthur and the Army Remove Garner"
wcc.104.d:0 "It appears President Garner's time is up. Douglas MacArthur marched into Washington D.C today, having declared Garner an 'ineffective president whose weakness has endangered America'. MacArthur's marchers reminded many in D.C. of Cox's Army of 1932, except these men are motivated to preserve the country from extremist forces. Garner's own cabinet has assured the public that this action is necessary, and have been working with MacArthur to install an emergency government from the White House - even as the majority of America looks on in shock. Civil war is imminent."
wcc.104.a:0 "So it has come to this"

### Alf Landon Path ###

wcc.105.t:0 "Alf Landon's Inaugural Address"
wcc.105.d:0 "Alf Landon was sworn in as the 31st president of the United States of America today. At his inaugural address Landon spoke of the challenges facing the nation in preserving a liberal democacy. Landon was quoted as saying 'Republicans must become practical liberals, which means that the Republican party has got to recognize the problems of a growing and complex industrial civilization. And I think I will awaken America to that.' Landon concluded with a promise to solve the Depression with entrepreneurship. Creating a new generation of millionaires that will bring pride back to the nation. Whether anyone will listen is another matter."
wcc.105.a:0 "I treasure our American Democracy"

# Economic Intervention route
wcc.106.t:0 "Landon Proposes Intervention"
wcc.106.d:0 "In response to the ongoing crisis, President Landon has proposed a bill to begin a series of economic intervention policies. The bill will create an insurance for bank deposits in treasury-approved banks that will not engage in risky investing. The bill also allows the federal government to create a comission to monitor stock market exchanges against fraud. Landon believes this will restore confidence in the market, creating jobs from one end of the country to the other. Both the SPA and the AFP have declared opposition to the bill for not going far enough, and for being too friendly to the very businesses that caused the depression in the first place. It will take some cooperation between Republicans and Democrats to overcome this united front of radicalism in Congress."
wcc.106.a:0 "This bill will not stop for them"

wcc.107.t:0 "Reed calls Landon Corruput"
wcc.107.d:0 "Alf Landon's election material made him out to be a self-made man, an entrepeneur who made his wealth starting from a small petroleum company. Landon's relationship with the oil industry culminated in the establishment of the United States Oil and Gas Association in his home state of Kansas, which freely associates with Standard Oil. To Reed and the SPA, this is the smoking gun that Landon is a class traitor, though to many these accusations have rang hollow, citing Landon as a man with the business connections to make the intervention bill stick."
wcc.107.a:0 "I started with nothing, Reed, just like you!"

wcc.108.t:0 "Huey Long calls Landon a Corporatist"
wcc.108.d:0 "Huey Long has responded, like Reed, by decrying Landon as a corrupt politician in Standard Oil's pocket. While he supported the bill as a step in the right direction he also recently spoke about how President Landon only cared for the rich and the monopolies that oppress true Americans, articulating criticism of Landon's fiscal conservatism during his tenure as Governor of Kansas. Huey Long also made sure to remind the people that, by all rights, he should be president and that he would have fixed this crisis already. President Landon, meanwhile, responded in a recent interview with newspapers that Long has a serious case of 'sour grapes', and political cartoons have begun depicting Long as a childish babboon - much to the public's amusement and Long's outrage."
wcc.108.a:0 "I am not Rockafeller, you fool!"

wcc.1080.t:0 "Murray calls Landon a Cosmopolitan"
wcc.1080.d:0 "William H. Murray has responded by decrying Landon as a corrupt politician appealing to bureaucrats, corporations and minorities who is using his economic expansion as a way to attack states rights. Denouncing him as a Republican tool most national newspapers have denounced Murray with the exception of the Fordist papers."
wcc.1080.a:0 "What an ignorant madman!"

wcc.109.t:0 "Traditional Democrats Close Ranks"
wcc.109.d:0 "While many Democratic Senators are leery of supporting a bill which has such vociferous opposition by the Old Democrats and SPA, especially considering their influence in America goes far beyond the number of seats they hold in Congress, they have responded poorly to the personal attacks on the president by Murray, Long and Reed. Despite internal opposition for interfering with the market, Democrats have indicated they will support the president's bill hoping it will help stem the radicalism caused by lack of economic opportunity."
wcc.109.a:0 "That's the solidarity I like"

wcc.110.t:0 "The 'New Deal' Bill Passes"
wcc.110.d:0 "The Economic Intervention Bill has managed to pass through Congress, and has been signed into law by President Landon. Banks are immediately ushered into silence as they reorganzie before recieving Treasury approval. The comission has begun to draft reforms to stock trading that will hopefully restore confidence in the markets. It is hard to say right away if this will solve the problem, but Landon hopes that this can be the first steps to fix the economy which all moderates can agree upon."
wcc.110.a:0 "We are finally awake to change"

wcc.111.t:0 "General Strike Spreads"
wcc.111.d:0 "The SPA's general strike has spread far and wide, after a call by Jack Reed to demonstrate against the recently-passed intervention bill, all but bringing the nation to a standstill in many industrial states. The city of St. Louis in particular has become a warzone, day to day life all but ended as strikers clash variously either with Federal forces or with AFP Minutemen. The sense of chaos has led to several riots as protests by regular citizens have turned into looting and civil unrest. People are leaving St. Louis by the thousands, calling for immediate government intervention."
wcc.111.a:0 "This is getting out of hand"

wcc.112.t:0 "Proposed Conference with Long and Reed"
wcc.112.d:0 "In response to the ongoing crisis, Alf Landon's Secretary of Commerce has proposed a conference with both Huey Long and Jack Reed to try to arrange some sort of compromise. The Secretary says that the measures in the bill will not work unless the strikes and the violence are brought to an end. However, some within the Republican party are saying that this plan of action will not work, and claiming a conference with Long and Reed will debase their party."
wcc.112.a:0 "Ignore Long and Reed"
wcc.112.b:0 "Arrange the conference"

wcc.113.t:0 "The Great St. Louis Riot"
wcc.113.d:0 "The SPA has been aggravating the workers in the area to expand the strike. Local businesses in St. Louis have become utterly paralyzed. Many of them turned to the America First Party to provide a solution. Within days, the streets were flooded with Minutemen. There are wild reports from the chaos ranging from Minutmen stopping petty crime in the absence of police, to them creating the crime. Soon the situation had erupted into a wide scale riot. The chaos has been splashed across every newspaper in America, and within days SPA and AFP forces have begun to mobilize. War is upon us."
wcc.113.a:0 "So it begins now, does it?"

wcc.114.t:0 "Conference Begins"
wcc.114.d:0 "The conference between President Landon and both Huey Long and Jack Reed began, but within days it was clear that it was a lost cause. Long and Reed argued constantly, on almost every issue, and the only thing that united them was their personal detestation of Landon and his intervention bill. It is apparent from the proceedings that Reed and Long's control over their parties were waning, not least of which is due to constant newspaper coverage of the conference citing the two men as 'obstructionist' and 'unreasonable'. Reed and Long both see the president as the corrupt tool of corporate America, and rather than compromise their demands are tantamount to rolling back the intervention bill which has already been voted on and passed through Congress! Both are nearly ready to walk out, despite the president's pleading that they compromise for the sake of peace in the country."
wcc.114.a:0 "I have to save this conference"

wcc.115.t:0 "Scandal Rocks the Conference"
wcc.115.d:0 "While President Landon's conference is finally beginning to make slow progress, American newspapers turn their attention from Reed and Long to a different target: namely the revelation of an internal memo within General Motors corporation which indicates that not only is the company's planned settlement with strikers intended to be only temporary... but that they and other companies are being bribed into settlement by the federal government. A temporary setback as they make concessions to strikers in exchange for a bailout with the understanding that changes made can be easily undone. While many are denying this memo's veracity, the sensational aspect of the news is giving new fire to AFP and SPA supporters and is threatening to quickly escalate out of control."
wcc.115.a:0 "Cut the conference short, we need to call GM"
wcc.115.b:0 "We must keep the conference going, no matter what"

wcc.1150.t:0 "MacArthur and the Army Remove Landon"
wcc.1150.d:0 "While the conference continued for several days, it rapidly became evident that the scandal was not going to end - instead it was escalating as other sources came forward with similar information, much of it pointing to an insider effort engineered by President Landon himself. Both Jack Reed and Huey Long abandoned the conference, and as Landon did his best to save face in Congress it was clear that blame was being placed squarely on him for the conference's failure. With the crisis spiralling, General Douglas MacArthur has stepped in - with the full approval of Landon's own cabinet - to install an emergency government in the White House 'to save America from extremist forces before it's too late'. While the government has tried to assure Americans that things are under control, it's quickly becoming clear that civil war is imminent."
wcc.1150.a:0 "So it has come to this"


### Victory in the civil war

wcc.116.t:0 "MacArthur's Power"
wcc.116.d:0 "With our victory in the civil war, a question must be decided upon. Should Douglas MacArthur resign as President and ensure a peaceful transition of power or should he remain in control to protect America? Hard liners within MacArthur's clique insist that the US will fall back into civil war without him, while Republicans and some Democrats claim MacArthur would be a tyrant to stay."
wcc.116.a:0 "MacArthur remains in power."
wcc.116.b:0 "MacArthur gives up power."

wcc.117.t:0 "Democracy Triumphs"
wcc.117.d:0 "At long last, the Republic has been saved. The radicals from both the left and the right which tried to destroy America have been defeated. We may have been battered and bruised but democracy has been saved."

Some think that we should promote more liberal and anti-syndicalist unions to be a ward against the influence of Syndicalism in politics. A few loyalists within the AFL and the defunct Knights of Labor are willing to cooperate with Congress in creating a national labor relations board. This board would be able to isolate IWW afilitaed unions, and give collective bargaining rights to unions that do not wish to see us hang.

This has led to the firing of over 5,000 federal employees who were accused of being homosexual. The press have mostly approved of this measure, although a few tabloids claim we are preaching hypocracy. One of the chief prosecutors, FBI Director J.

This amendment would make it so that the President of the United States of America is elected by the direct popular suffrage of the country. The current Electoral College system was last modified in the 14th Amendment almost a century ago. The bill, as proposed by a minority coalition of Social Democrats within the Republicans and Democrats has very little chance of succeeding. It is claimed by the supporters that doing this will help prevent another crisis like the 1936 crisis from happening again. The party leadership of both e Republicans and Democrats disagree, saying that the Electoral College was the only thing that kept the United States from totally dissolving in 1936.

wcc.152.d:0 "During the 1930s, a large part of the NAACP's activities were taken up by litigation in favour of African American rights. This was due to the retreating strength of the black vote and the diminishing ability of African Americans to reach office after Plessy v. Ferguson. This avenue was also pursued by the syndicalist aligned International Labor Defence, who countered the NAACP for a decade in a competition for the hearts of black voters. Seeing no other option and being unwilling to ever compromise with socialists, NAACP leader Walter Francis White has decided to cooperate with the FBI in an anti-socialist puiblic relations campaign. Whether this truly motivates civil rights or further dilutes the current remains to be seen."

A proposed civil works program to electrify the Southwest using hydroelectric power hit a snag as Democrats could not agree on the role of public works in the marketplace. The Works would be able to undercut private electricity companies because it would be able to cross state borders and build dams on public land.

The mountains on either side of the canyon were difficult of access with neither road nor trail, and their rocks were protected by neither trees nor grass from the blazing heat of the sun.

Taylor sings to promote unity in America over politics, and cooperation instead of victory."

wcc.182.t:0 "Barkley Ends The Corvee System"
wcc.182.d:0 "A division appears between President Barkley and the Democratic Party on Fair Deal Infrastructure. A Congressional debate brought up the idea of allowing a smaller community works to be paid by the government, with repair being handled by the Corvée system. The Corvée system is a tax imposed to pay for prisoners to repair public works. President Barkley spoke out against this idea, as his time in Kentucky taught him that penal labour will never surpass contract labour. This stand also puts pressure on Southern Democrats in his own party that support a state-financed and cheap reconstruction plan. National attention to the Corvée system has led to most states outlawing it."
wcc.182.a:0 "Rightfully So."

wcc.183.t:0 "Russel's Chain Gang Labor Exposed"
wcc.183.d:0 "Richard Russell's career in Georgia prior to the White House wasn't without its controversy. As a cost-cutting measure, Russell authorized the use of penal labour to undertake constructions for the state. This free labour was compounded by poor living conditions and has eventually come back to haunt Russell. A former prisoner who had his conviction overturned has written a book entitled 'I Am a Fugitive from a Georgia Chain Gang!'. This book describes a corrupt penal system and puts the blame on now-President Russell. Those critical of the President are having a field day with this. Rumours of Hollywood planning a movie on this book have also circulated."
wcc.183.a:0 "Who would believe a Prisoner?"

wcc.184.t:0 "Gangsters Miss Dewey By A Hair"
wcc.184.d:0 "Dewey's past came gunning for him one Sunday morning at a D.C. restaurant. Gangsters, sent by the Dutch Schultz to avenge his upcoming execution tried shooting at him through the windows. Fortunately, the Secret Service was able to hide President Dewey, and nabbed the gangsters responsible. As a result, Dewey has doubled his security and pressed for further crackdowns nationwide on crime syndicates, as this attempt may encourage copycats. Both Democrat and Republican in Congress have called J Edgar Hoover into Congress to explain how the FBI did not see this coming. Many on the fence about Dewey are now glad their President has survived such a vile plot."
wcc.184.a:0 "Close Call."

wcc.301.d:0 "The aftermath of the Second Civil War has given us time to assess not only the holes in our military capabilities, but potential improvements as well. Our General Staff has determined that we can outpace conventional engine based aeroplanes with the new fuel and thrust tech developed by Lawrence Bell. At the same time, we have procured enough engineers and scientists for Neddermeyer's idea for a plutonium gun nuclear weapon."

wcc.303.t:0 "Winchester Project"
wcc.303.d:0 "The project ran into a significant problem when it was discovered that the nuclear material Plutonium has a fission rate too fast for a bullet. The solution came in the form of depleted Uranium initially planned for a different nuclear project. This makes the weapon barely ethical under normal nuclear waste usage guidelines, and creates the issue of intentional biological damage from radiation on the target. Nonetheless, the Thin Man is a success"
wcc.303.a:0 "We are safe from Oppenheimer's deadly toy."

wcc.304.t:0 "The War and Peace Studies"
wcc.304.d:0 "In the past, our diplomatic conduct has been at the whim of ambassadors, many of whom had bought their positions from the party. The world we live in is too dangerous to afford such flippant choices to be made by agents of America, it is General MacArthur's opinion that a new approach to foreign policy is necessary, one that derives consensus from a group of trusted experts. This is what inspired the War and Peace Studies, a calling for only the brightest to represent America in this brave new world. This entity, the so-called the Council on Foreign Relations, will advise General MacArthur on how to suppress radical forces from any corner of the world."
wcc.304.a:0 "Constrained by diplomats no more."

wcc.305.t:0 "The White House and Xanadu"
wcc.305.d:0 "A surprising amount of support came from the pages of the many Hearst Newspapers that dot America. These papers drew up the image of MacArthur as the heroic Cincinnatus, hearing the call to save the Republic from certain destruction. A beacon for MacArthur's allies and the creation of an almost mythical personage through films and newspaper cartoons, Hearst has served as a stabilizing factor to the ship of the state. Even Hearst's attacks on radical unions and populists seemed to echo the words of MacArthur's radio speeches."
wcc.305.a:0 "We appreciate your support."

wcc.306.t:0 "The New Normal in America"
wcc.306.d:0 "When General MacArthur announced that he would not step down as leader those years ago, it was under the pretence of emergency. At the time. hundreds of thousands of Americas were unaccounted for, radicals prowled the countryside funding their politics with looted money, and the democratic pillar was unready to hold up the state. These past few years have seen a great many galvanize into hardy MacArthurites, and a new flavour of politician has emerged in the House of Representatives. These Congressmen see the need for an integral military role to check and nurture the business environment and ensure the rights of citizens cannot be infringed due to gridlock."

wcc.307.t:0 "Into the Wild Blue Yonder"
wcc.307.d:0 "While the United States has an air force, the capability to defend the skies and project power, we do not have an Air Force. The role is split between the US Army in service of our Paratroopers, and the US Navy aboard our Aircraft Carriers. The contention the General Staff addresses today is the ultimate fate of the Air Force, and to which branch should tradition take after. Those in favour of the Army contend that future operations will most likely be in ground support or air drops, while Navy advocates claim that Aircraft are essential to the future of Naval Warfare in engagements large and small. We must choose a side."

wcc.308.d:0 "In the last few years, our military research has focused on the potential for internal conflict, narrowing our focus and budget for longer-term projects. This years' Congressional Budget has fortunately found some money to allocate to a long-term project. Three plans are presented to the military high command to meet and exceed the military projects of our rivals. The first is a rocket by Goddard theoretically capable of delivering explosives from miles away without risking pilot lives. The second is Oppenheimer's planned theoretical bomb using radioactive heavy metals as researched in Austria and Germany. The third is a much cheaper plan as proposed by the eccentric Wilhelm Reich, he claims that a bomb can be made much cheaper using his own personal physics research. On our part, we don't know much about what Wilhelm Reich is talking about, but his reputation in Austria gives us some comfort into whatever science he's using."

wcc.309.d:0 "At home again in Roswell, New Mexico, Goddard again goes to launch test rockets. The last time he was here, the rockets were smaller than his thigh, and reached only a thousand feet in height. Now the rockets soar miles over the desert and touch down with their dummy weights. Goddard's refusal to detonate explosive rockets on the Continental United States prevent the full scale of the damage to be known."
wcc.309.a:0 "Good boy Goddard."

wcc.310.t:0 "Oppenheimer's Bomb a Success"
wcc.310.d:0 "An invitation by Oppenheimer was sent out to nuclear researchers, physicists, and engineers throughout Europe. The promise of escaping persecution in Europe has resounded most strongly to Jewish scientists, some of whom emigrated to the US for the project. After a year and a half of experimentation and some cooperation with colleagues in Europe, a working atomic bomb is ready to be tested. The skies of Alamogordo New Mexico lit up in a flash of destruction as the test bomb Valediction exploded. Oppenheimer later said that the bomb was named after his favourite John Donne poem."
wcc.310.a:0 "The breath goes now."

wcc.311.t:0 "Reich's Failed Explosion"
wcc.311.d:0 "After many delays and several attempts to obfuscate the general staff, Wilhelm Reich's bomb project is discontinued and millions of dollars wasted on bunk. This became apparent to Reich's observers when tests showing his energy, named Orgone, could induce exothermic reactions that only he and his associates could see. The bomb itself being a hollow shell with layers of metals covering that never did explode, save for its collapse when Reich attempted to destroy it during the investigation. This embarrassment is currently making its rounds in the papers."

wcc.500.t:0 "Garner-Wagner Bill Re-Introduced"
wcc.500.d:0 "With assurances made by President Hoover that, unlike in 1932, this time he will not veto the bill, Democratic Senator Robert Wagner and Speaker of the House John Nance Garner have re-introduced their unemployment relief legislation package. Many in Congress feel that the package does not go nearly far enough, while others wonder how America - in the midst of a massive economic crisis - will possibly ever pay for it. The presence of Senators from the AFP and the SPA also complicates things immensely. Even with Hoover's pledge, it's unknown if Garner-Wagner has a real chance of passing."
wcc.500.a:0 "We shall see"

wcc.501.t:0 "Long and Reed Demand Changes"
wcc.501.d:0 "As expected, the early challenges to the Garner-Wagner Bill have come from the AFP and the SPA. Huey Long and his AFP Senators have demanded a vast increase in the social security provisions the bill provides, provisions most other Senators say America could never afford. Jack Reed and the SPA, meanwhile, say the bill doesn't do enough to protect the average worker, particularly from exploitation by struggling corporations. Both parties have attracted a lot of media attention, adding to the general sense of disorder and tension in Congress."
wcc.501.a:0 "Interesting"

wcc.502.t:0 "Senators Break Ranks"
wcc.502.d:0 "After weeks of negotiations, a number of establishment Senators have broken ranks over the coming vote on the Garner-Wagner Bill - most notably Robert Wagner, one of the bill's proposers, who says he will not vote for the bill unless protections for federal unemployment insurance are re-added. Many other Democrat and Republican Senators are concerned about the influence of the AFP and the SPA, and claim they will not vote for the bill if *any* concessions are made to either group... though others say that not courting either the AFP or SPA will make passage difficult if not impossible. President Hoover will need to intervene in order to save the bill."
wcc.502.a:0 "Pledge support to Wagner and the establishment Senators"
wcc.502.b:0 "Force the establishment to compromise with the AFP"
wcc.502.c:0 "Force the establishment to compromise with the SPA"

wcc.503.t:0 "Long and Reed Furious"
wcc.503.d:0 "Both Huey Long's AFP and Jack Reed's SPA have reacted with fury at President Hoover's endorsement of establishment Senators. They have vowed to sink the Garner-Wagner Bill, claiming that the public is being deceived by a 'corrupt government which refuses to recognize the reality of America'. While the parties have both gained a considerable boost in support from their base, Democratic and Republican fortunes have improved somewhat, and there is a feeling that both have a better chance going into the next election... provided the bill actually passes."
wcc.503.a:0 "Let's hope it does!"

wcc.504.t:0 "Compromise with the AFP"
wcc.504.d:0 "Recent days have resulted in a compromise between many establishment Senators and the America First Party, with numerous extra provisions included for farm relief and unemployment protection - though nowhere near as far as the AFP originally demanded. Even so, Huey Long has declared this as a victory and is riding high in recent polls. Both Jack Reed's SPA and a large number of Republican Senators have declared this a betrayal of the American public, however, and have vowed to sink the Garner-Wagner bill when the vote comes."
wcc.504.a:0 "We've done what we can..."

wcc.505.t:0 "Compromise with the SPA"
wcc.505.d:0 "Recent days have resulted in a compromise between many establishment Senators and the Socialist Party of America, with numerous extra provisions included for worker protections and unemployment relief - though nowhere near as far as the SPA originally demanded. Even so, Jack Reed has declared this as a victory and is riding high in recent polls. Both Huey Long's AFP and a large number of Democratic Senators have declared this a betrayal of the American public, however, and have vowed to sink the Garner-Wagner bill when the vote comes."

wcc.507.t:0 "The Garner-Wagner Bill Passes!"
wcc.507.d:0 "Though the vote was incredibly close, the Garner-Wagner bill has passed Congress. People throughout the United States are celebrating this welcome relief to the country's disastrous economic situation, though many within the government are wondering: how will the bill now be paid for?"
wcc.507.a:0 "A victory for us all!"

wcc.508.t:0 "The Garner-Wagner Bill Fails!"
wcc.508.d:0 "After an incredibly close vote in Congress, the Garner-Wagner bill failed to pass. While several groups are declaring personal victory, protests have broken out in various parts of the country. There will be no relief for the American worker, and many have declared the government to be corrupt and dysfunctional. There will be considerable time for blame, but for the moment the Hoover government's concerns must turn to the growing violence throughout American cities - violence which is expected to only worsen in the months leading up to the election."
wcc.508.a:0 "All that for nothing..."

wcc.509.t:0 "War Plan White"
wcc.509.d:0 "The time has come to dust off one of the American military's colour-coded war plans, this one meant for dealing with domestic disturbances and insurgencies. It cannot come a moment too soon, as violence is escalating in areas where the AFP and the SPA have been contending with local authorities for dominance. Minnesota and North Carolina are the two states where the violence is at its height, and - at the moment - we can only focus our efforts in one place."

wcc.510.t:0 "Bringing out the National Guard"
wcc.510.d:0 "The National Guard has been deployed for over six months now, fighting to maintain security in a number of American cities, but there is a growing fear that commanders within the Guard are not entirely loyal to the Republic, that many harbor sympathies for the AFP and the SPA. More focus needs to be put on strengthening the units we know are loyal. We also need to decide where to focus their deployment, for the time being."

wcc.511.t:0 "General MacArthur's Plan"
wcc.511.d:0 "There is growing concern that America is descending into a possible civil war, and that - despite all our efforts to maintain security - supporters of the AFP and the SPA simply have too much influence in some parts of the country. General Douglas MacArthur has unveiled a plan to infiltrate key areas in either New York City or southern Texas. Both are of high importance, New York for its industry and Texas for its oil, and both are at high risk to takeover. MacArthur says that these efforts might still come to naught if the AFP and SPA's power become too great, but he believes it will greatly increase the government's chances of maintaining control should it come to an armed conflict."
wcc.511.a:0 "New York City is of vital importance"
wcc.511.b:0 "We absolutely need that Texan oil"

wcc.512.t:0 "The Hawking Plan"
wcc.512.d:0 "Junior Democratic Senator Thomas Hawking has introduced a bill which will see the relief efforts largely funded by taxing American corporations - in exchange for hefty tax considerations down the line, once the economy has recovered. This has caused considerably controversy in some corners, especially among AFP and SPA supporters. Others say it would be far too easy for the next government to reverse the decision, leaving the corporations holding the bag and even worse off than they were before. Regardless, there is enough support to see the bill passed - and, as an added bonus, the agency to coordinate the efforts could be placed in either Minneapolils or in Charlotte, with the added bonus of new employment weakening what are AFP and SPA strongholds."
wcc.512.a:0 "Base the agency in Minneapolis"
wcc.512.b:0 "Base the agency in Charlotte"

wcc.513.t:0 "The New Industrial Act"
wcc.513.d:0 "As an offshoot of the Hawking Plan, relief efforts will see new industrial growth in several vital areas - primarily in the military sector. Several of these new companies are planned for Denver, Colorado. At least one other area can be promoted, and the cabinet believes that putting them in depressed areas which are currently strongholds of the AFP or SPA may see their influence in those areas drastically weakened."
wcc.513.a:0 "Promote the industry in Minnesota"

wcc.513.c:0 "Promote the industry in Tennessee"

wcc.514.t:0 "The Shipyard Funding Scheme"
wcc.514.d:0 "The Hawking Plan has led to two major shipbuilding companies vying for a federal contract, one in New York City and the other in Corpus Christi. Both would mean a large number of jobs for the area, and would be a boon for our control over the region. The problem is that word of the contract has gotten out, and whichever city we *don't* choose will likely be enraged, giving strength to the AFP or the SPA in the region."
wcc.514.a:0 "Give the contract to New York City"
wcc.514.b:0 "Give the contract to Corpus Christi"

wcc.515.t:0 "America Demands War Debts"
wcc.515.d:0 "It came as a surprise to the Canadian government, but the ambassador from [WCC.GetNameDef] has demanded that the Canadian government immediately begin repaying the war debts incurred during the Weltkrieg. While the Americans are gripped in an economic crisis, one Canada has largely avoided, they must know the Canadians can never repay the debt... not all at once, and there was a tacit agreement after the war that the debts wouldn't be repaid until the Home Islands were recaptured. For the Americans to demand it now, they must either be desperate or must be catering to the more warlike and isolationist elements in their government."
wcc.515.a:0 "Whatever the reason, we cannot do as they demand"

wcc.516.t:0 "Canada Refuses"
wcc.516.d:0 "The Canadian government has responded to the demand with a flat refusal. The debt, they say, was never meant to be repaid until the Home Islands were retaken - as most was incurred by the United Kingdom, a government which is now in exile. Even so, their refusal has done its job and fired up the isolationist elements of the American government. President Hoover's government has the support it needs, at the cost of relations with the Canadians."
wcc.516.a:0 "So be it"

wcc.517.t:0 "Compromise with America?"
wcc.517.d:0 "There has been a break in the chilly relations with the American government since their demand for debt repayment. They have approached us with an offer: economic assistance now, and an agreement to increase trade with the Entente, in exchange for the rest of the debt being delayed until the Home Isles are retaken... which was, aides point out, the original deal to begin with. It might be a way to restore goodwill with our southern neighbors, and even help them, though some are suggesting that there's no point in shoveling our limited funds into a bottomless pit. America is lost, they say, and we should look to our own first."
wcc.517.a:0 "We agree to the compromise"
wcc.517.b:0 "They are on their own"

wcc.518.t:0 "Canada Agrees to Compromise"
wcc.518.d:0 "The Canadian government has reluctantly agreed to the compromise, giving us what repayment they can now and accepting the deferment until the Home Isles have been retaken. In exchange, a trade agreement has been put in place with the Entente, something that's likely beneficial for us all. The main downside is that the agreement has been viewed as treachery by the AFP and the SPA, both of which claim our corrupt government has betrayed the very people they fired up only moments before."
wcc.518.a:0 "We'll take what we can get"

wcc.519.t:0 "Canada Refuses the Compromise"
wcc.519.d:0 "The Canadian government has refused our offer of compromise, leading to economic sanctions applied by both sides. The chance of this escalating to war is slight, but the damage is done. We'll have to be satisfied with the gains we've made, and the increased revenue from the tarriffs."
wcc.519.a:0 "It was worth a try"

wcc.520.t:0 "Long Bans the SPA from Congress"
wcc.520.d:0 "In a fiery speech, President Long declared that his intended reforms would have to wait - of far more pressing importance was the SPA and its insidious influence over America. The ongoing New Year's Strike is its doing, and it is America's number one public enemy. An executive order banned the SPA from Congress, and named the Minutemen as acting with emergency invested authority as executors of the president's will. While some in the halls of power are relieved to see action being taken against the SPA, many more are alarmed by President Long's use of executive power."
wcc.520.a:0 "So must it be"

wcc.521.t:0 "Reed Bans America First from Congress"
wcc.521.d:0 "In a fiery speech, President Reed declared that his intended reforms would have to wait - of far more pressing importance was the America First Party and its insidious influence over America. So long as the Minutemen milita run rampant, attacking strikers and innocent Americans alike, it will be America's number one public enemy. An executive order banned the AFP from Congress, and called on the SPA milita to act as emergency reinforcement to government forces. While some in the halls of power are relieved to see action being taken against the Minutemen, many more are alarmed by President Reed's use of executive power."

wcc.522.t:0 "Executive Order 7061: Declare AFP Terrorist Organization"
wcc.522.d:0 "Citing national concerns due to the anarchistic nature of the Minutemen and the America First Party, Jack Reed has passed an executive order that has declared them an illegal organization which seeks to overthrow the country, and as such all force shall be used to oppose them. Reed has drawn a direct comparison between the Minutemen and the terrorist attacks that occured on Preparedness Day in 1916, and Wall Street in 1920. The Minutemen are now subject to the Sedition Act of 1918, prosecuted as an anti-recruitment and vigilante group."
wcc.522.a:0 "Excellent!"

wcc.523.t:0 "Long Defies the Order"
wcc.523.d:0 "Huey Long publicly denounced Reed's executive order as being unconstitutional and an act meant to suppress opposition to his rule and pave the way for syndialist reforms in America. Long has organized large rallies and protests with the Minutemen there to keep the protesters safe from aggression. These highly reported-on protests have seen union strikers beaten by Minutemen without interference from the police, which calls into question Reed's ability to protect Americans."
wcc.523.a:0 "Rely on the police to keep control"

wcc.524.t:0 "Police Forces Defy Reed"
wcc.524.d:0 "In an unexpected move, the police have refused to enforce the various executive orders. Within Atlanta, New Orleans, Houston, and other cities scattered throughout the American South, they have declared a Police Strike in solidarity with the AFP. While they worked to keep order, Police union leaders publicly declare that they would not follow the Laws of 'Reed the Tyrant'. Thus Reed has called in the US Army to enforce his laws."
wcc.524.a:0 "Send in the big boys"

wcc.525.t:0 "The Minutemen clash with the SPA"
wcc.525.d:0 "When government foces, bolstered by SPA milita, arrived in the American South to enforce the laws of the President, they were immediately set upon by Minutemen and supporters of the AFP. Shoot-outs quickly became commonplace, and the violence quickly spread throughout almost every major city in the Americna South. It has quickly noticed that the governmnet has no remaining authority there."

MacArthur's marchers reminded many in D.C of Cox's Army of 1932, except these men are motivated to preserve the status quo, and were cheered instead of booed. Having been tipped off by SPA informants in MacArthur's command staff, Reed was able to stay ahead of the general and has escaped to Chicago.

wcc.530.t:0 "An Envoy from the East"
wcc.530.d:0 "Ever since word arrived in [Root.GetNameDef] regarding General MacArthur willingly stepping down from power out east, we have wondered if we would hear from the new government. The ceasefire has held, after all - so do they desire peace? Our question has been answered with the arrival of an envoy from the Federal government. They wish to meet once again, this time to talk about a reunion between our democratic governments. Most here in the west are willing, but there are many who say that MacArthur must first pay for his crimes. He is as much a traitor as Long and Reed, after all... if they are not willing to put him on trial as such, then how can we ever trust their word?"

According to [From.GetNameDef], he is as much responsible for the death and destruction of the civil war as Reed and Long, and so long as he is not held to the same example as those men they cannot trust that our return to democracy is real. It could be done, and many in our cabinet say it must be, for the sake of peace, but truth be told MacArthur is considered by many Americans to be a hero. He won the civil war for us. To repay him this way seems almost unthinkable."

After several meetings between the two governments, the only condition of the Pacific States of America government was that General Douglas MacArthur be arrested and tried for treason. The reasoning, according to American officials, was that the West considered MacArthur just as much a traitor as Huey Long and Jack Reed, and just as responsible for the death and destruction that ensued. Many in the United States consider MacArthur a hero, however, so when news was revealed of his arrest, angry demonstrations were just as prevalent as celebrations at the Pacific government's agreement to rejoin. It will likely take years for MacArthur's case to go to trial, and without a doubt will be a sensation, but for now the American Civil War is truly over."

wcc.600.d:0 "The defense of the United States has always been an uphill battle. Stretched thin against the vast breadth of the North American continent, the United States Army has had little chance to distinguish itself throughout its 160 year history. It won the bare minimum of victories to maintain American independence during the Revolution and the War of 1812. It performed admirably against a corrupt regime in the Mexican-American War but half of those forces would provide the seed for the fledgeling Confederate Army during the ensuing Civil War. More recently the Army performed barely adequately to subdue the heavily outgunned Spanish and struggled to suppress the half-starved Filipino Insurrection more than 30 years ago. Prevented from joining in the Weltkrieg on either side, it has suffered in both doctrine and technology, with no tanks at all and a small Air Corps subsidiary to the ground forces. With the hobbled lion that was the British Empire on the northern frontier and a syndicalist stronghold poised in the south, the U.S. Army must be asked to defend the Republic from enemies within and without, and few agree that they are up to the task."

wcc.601.d:0 "The United States Navy, long the darling child of the American defense establishment has been a strong force in global maritime affairs for nearly fifty years. A rival even to the vaunted Kaiserliche Marine and Royal Navy at their height in the Weltkrieg, it has defended America's shores and sallied forth to spread stability and democracy for nigh on 160 years. From John Paul Jones' raid on the British mainland to the Battle of Manila Bay, the Navy has provided the security needed by the republic from those that would infringe upon our independence from beyond the seas. All is not well in the modern day, however. The navy's ships are old, her flagships Weltkrieg-era dreadnoughts even as Germany and the Syndicalists engage in a new naval arms race, and the tattered remnants of the Royal Navy lick their wounds. New carriers have been commissioned, but they are nowhere near ready to take on the imperial Japanese fleet. The Marine Corps fares better, hardened as they are by constant action in tropical locals, but they are small, only a few regiments strong, and are powerless to affect increasing tension at home from their far-flung island bases. The honor guard in Washington D.C. look increasingly powerless as violence in the nation's capital increases. Our White ships might dominate the waves but many question whether it will be enough to face the gathering storm n the horizon."

Now not only is a reform plan to deal with the imminent crisis necessary, but also urgent as the rebellious states threaten the unity of America. Luckily for us, several staff members had already been advocating for reform plans since the early 1920s, and they have been summoned by High Command to a meeting for them to lay out their plans. After a session full of army formalities, 4-Star General Malin Craig presented a restructuring and mobilization plan which would focus on trying to arm as many men as possible while improving and enhancing the High Command to have an edge in planning over our enemies. While many conservative members aplauded his traditionalist stance, Major General Adna R. Chaffee criticized his stance, quoting several instances in which planning and mass mobilization didn't earn the victory to the French in the Weltkrieg, and instead advocating for the adoption of the 'Thunderbolt': Fast moving armies supporting themselves on motorized and mechanized elements to quickly exploit enemy weak spots. While both sides got gridlocked into a discussion for radically different plans, Major General Leslie McNair offered an alternative solution: The American strength lies with its industry, and it is clear that in order to win, that strength should be exploited to its fullest. For that he proposes the restoration of the late 1920s and early 1930s artillery examination boards and the development of anti air and anti tank batteries to counter-act any enemy developments on this front.

However, air development during these last decades have proven that a strong air force is a vital asset for an army who wishes to come out victorious from the battlefield. Unfortunately, the Army High Command in many aspects refuses to acknowledge this, and as a result, spark conflict with many Air Branch generals who wish to direct the development of their own branch. With the country's integrity at stake, the High Command has decided to negotiate with the Air Force Generals, and the result of the negotiations is pretty clear: The Air Branch will not stand for a continuation of the Status Quo, and demands that at best, their force is given significant autonomy from the Army and reorganize as the United States Army Air Force, and at worse for the United States Army Air Corps to be expanded and supported to suit the needs of the battlefield. With the High Command being undecided on the issue, the final decision has been sent to the War Department, where it has been forwarded to the Secretary of Defense to decide on the matter."

After finishing a rigorous conditioning and training program started two weeks ago, a lottery was made to decide the jumping order of the experimental paradropping platoon made up of volunteers. When the Douglas C-33 took off from the Langley Air Field and finally was put into position to start the experiment, Second Lieutenant William T. Ryder became the first American Paratrooper after making his jump and landing near Fort Benning. The second man, however, refused to jump, and so the first enlisted man to become a paratrooper was Pvt. William N. "Red" King, and then the remaining 8 platoon members in the aircraft. After their touchdown, they quickly reached the rendezvous point and completed their excercise goals, making the experiment a success."

While originally the high training standards and relatively high mortal risk initially caused few volunteers to show up, the high command authorized a triplication of the paratrooper wage as opposed to the foot soldier wage. Soon enough, the 501st Parachute Battalion was formed, quickly followed by other battalions and regiments. After a week recruitment, the number of volunteers was enough to form 5 paratrooper divisions for us to utilize. While these divisions still lack combat experience, this breakthrough in Airborne tactics should not be underestimated, and the High Command is looking forward to seeing their investment in these divisions pay off."

While the Secretary has managed to calm the General down and reassure him that the army's role in the battlefield will always come first, word of the meeting has gone out and many Admirals, including MacArthur's bitter rival Admiral Hart, are already sending letters asking for MacArthur's resignation.

The manual consists of seven chapters – the first titled “General” followed by six chapters describing employment of antitank units in various scenarios (during the advance, halts, the development of the battle, defensive maneuvers, retrograde movements, and offensive operations). The document highlights the specific capabilities of tanks that makes them a unique threat on a modern battlefield characterized by open warfare, like the tank's speed and mobility which, when combined with the lack of a stabilized front, increased the need to ensure protection of flanks and rear areas against armored attacks. While officer trainees will loathe having another manual to read in the pile, this one is quickly turning into a must after the recent engagements."

In order to present his idea more coherently to high command, he has recently written the 'Armored Force Tentative Table of Organization' where the Combat Command, as he describes it, should be flexible organization that should not have dedicated battalions. Instead, tank, armored infantry, and armored field artillery battalions, as well as smaller units of tank destroyers, engineers, and mechanized cavalry have to be assigned as needed in order to accomplish any given mission. To achieve this, he wishes to split the armored division into the combat commands named "A" for the main force, "B" for flank defense, and "R" for reserve units. While his concept is clearly inspired in the German 'Kampfgruppe' concept, the High Command has received his idea with open arms and are starting to implement the new organization system across the board as well as distributing the new manual to the field officers."

Brodie, which gave it its current nickname. While adopted, the US never saw a need to mass produce it, and instead continued to buy the model from the British in the cheap during their depression in the early 1920s. While these helmets were effective at the time, our experience in the civil war has proven that even the Brodie is no longer suitable for modern combat and, as such, a research team was created under Major Harold G. Sydenham to look for alternatives. The research team concluded that by removing the Brodie's brim, by adding side pieces and earpiece, and by incorporating the suspension system into a separate inner liner, the new helmet could provide a protection the Brodie could never afford. The original test item was known as the TS3, and it received a favorable report from the Infantry Board in the recent weeks.

The ALA presented their idea to the United Service Organizations and The Red Cross, who have received their idea enthusiastically and begun setting up more than four hundred recreational clubs on the outskirts of military camps. The Red Cross wanted books to send to military hospitals, remote camps with no libraries, their overseas clubs, and prisoners of war. The two organizations decided to split the project's funding, while the ALA provided technical know-how and both began campaigning for government approval.

From 10.827.097 books gathered in the last year, an unacceptably high percentage of these were unsuitable, with VBC staffers having discarded 5,052,858 books.

While the proposal was sound, a clause in Trautmant's proposal sparked controversy in the High Command Meeting. As he stated that all books should be, in all circumstances, acceptable to both services, and that works with 'Statements or attitudes offensive to our Allies, any religious or racial group, or not in accord 'with the spirit of American democracy'' should be discarded.

However, fighting in the American mountains, cities and forests have proved not only that they were wronged, but we have paid the price dearly for it, as we lack the means to counter-act enemy sniper operations, let alone send off snipers of our own to eliminate High Value Targets.

Originally the building was meant to be placed in a location known as the Arlington Farms, where the road shape resembles a Pentagon, which has forced the architect team to adapt the design to said geographic space, but many in the Department are questioning if positioning the building between the cementery, which by all means is considered hallowed ground for every american, and the stunning view of Washington D.C. is really appropiate, an two new locations have been proposed for the construction.

###############################################

WCC_DOUGLAS_MACARTHUR_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W 26 January, 1880, in Little Rock, Arkansas, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Douglas 'Big Chief' MacArthur, born from a long family line of military men, graduated from West Point as an Engineer Corps second lieutenant in 1903 with the highest grade in the academy's history. In 1904, he was promoted to first lieutenant and travelled to the Philippines in order to help his father with the construction of their headquarters. Through his father's influence, MacArthur quickly became a military advisor to President Theodore Roosevelt until 1908, where he took command of an engineer company in Fort Leavenworth, reaching the rank of Captain in 1911. All these high profile postings allowed him to join the American General Staff in 1912, at the young age of 32. MacArthur took part in the occupation of Veracruz, learning Spanish in a matter of weeks and taking part in several small skirmishes with the rebels. He returned to America in 1919, when he was assigned as the Director of the United States' Military Academy at West Point. In 1922, he returned to the Philippines, this time to inspect the island's defence status, and having to intervene personally to end mutiny of Philippino scouts. With his promotion to Major General in 1925, his notoriety only grew and grew, being sent to the 1928 Olympic games in the Netherlands to head the American Olympic Committee. However, MacArthur was also forced to comply with orders he didn't agree with, like the court martial of Brigadier General Billy Mitchell, which MacArthur has called 'one of the most distasteful orders I ever received'. During the 'Bonus March', MacArthur was forced, under President Hoover's orders, to put down the 'Bonus Army' despite MacArthur's agreeing with the protestors' demands. He has since then become the highest ranking American Officer, although he has had a troubled relation with the government's executive branch.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Born from a family that fought in the Civil War, MacArthur is willing to do whatever is necessary to keep America as a united, great and free country."
WCC_DWIGHT_EISENHOWER_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W October 14, 1890, in Denison, Texas, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Dwight David 'Ike' Eisenhower, a fan of military history since a young age, applied for both West Point and Annapolis in 1910, being accepted in the former after the highest ranking candidate failed the physical requirement in 1911. He graduated in 1915 along with Omar Bradley and was almost discharged due to a leg injury, but West Point's chief medical officer interceded with the War Department and obtained a commission for him. Eisenhower would be posted with the 19th Infantry Regiment in the Mexican Border and reached the rank of Captain in 1917. He was transferred to Fort Benning in late 1918, where he remained training with the Camp Polk Tank school until the 1919 Motor Transport Corps convoy. 'Ike' was promoted to Major in 1920. His interest in armored warfare only grew and grew, and quickly joined Patton's and Van Voorhis in their requests of increased funding for a mechanization program. In 1924, he was sent to Panama, where he served under General Fox Conner, who decided to tutor 'Ike' into philosophy, military history and military theory and was selected in 1925 for the Command and General Staff College, graduating first in a class of 245 officers. Conner would help 'Ike' to get into the War College, becoming one of the youngest students of the academy and receiving the praise of General Pershing himself. After his graduation, he was assigned to the Army War College, and then served as executive officer to Major General George Van Horn Moseley, Assistant Secretary of War, from 1929 to 1933. Since then he has served as chief military aide of General Douglas MacArthur, accompanying him to the Philippines, where he served as assistant military adviser to the Philippine government. Since then, he has become MacArthur's undisputed second in command, and while their personalities tend to clash often, many claim that their skills complement each other."
WCC_OMAR_BRADLEY_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W February 12, 1893, in Clark, Missouri, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Omar Nelson 'Brad' Bradley signed up to join the United States Military Academy in 1911, where he finished second in the placements for the appointments. However, the winner couldn't accept the congressional appointment for the academy, so it was granted to Bradley. He graduated in 1915 and was commissioned as an infantry second lieutenant, and becoming a close friend of another graduate of the same class, Dwight D. Eisenhower. He was assigned to the 14th Infantry Regiment stationed in the Mexican border, reaching the rank of Captain in 1917 and being transferred to guard the copper mines in Butte, Montana, remaining in garrison duties for the rest of the decade. From 1920 to 1924, he worked as a math teacher in West Point, reaching the rank of Major in 1924 and undergoing the advanced infantry course at Fort Benning. Bradley later studied at the U.S. Army Command and General Staff School, graduating in 1929 and serving as an instructor in tactics at the U.S. Army Infantry School, where he met and established good relations with Lt.Col. George Marshall. He taught in West Point from 1929 to 1934, where he took a break to study at the U.S. Army War College, reaching the rank of lieutenant colonel. With the fears that the War Plan Blue might be executed in the near future, Bradley was first promoted to Brigadier General and then to Field Marshal along with Eisenhower by MacArthur's own request.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Largely considered one of the most dependable generals of the US Army, Marshall once described him as 'A quiet, unassuming and capable man, with sound common sense. He has an absolute dependability. Give him a job and forget it' and that reputation may have helped to speed up his promotion."
WCC_GEORGE_MARSHALL_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W December 21, 1880, in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W George Catlett Marshall Jr. began his military career in the Virginia Military Institute in 1900, graduating in 1902 as a second lieutenant of the United States Army. Marshall was posted in the Philippines during the Philippine-American war, as well as helping to contain guerrilla operations in the area post-war. During the Weltkrieg, Marshall was sent to France, along with many other American officers as observers, where he was promoted to Captain for his observations. After working as aide-de-camp of General Pershing for a short time in 1919, he began being assigned to several positions in the army, mainly to relay his experience in the Weltkrieg to more inexperienced officers as well as helping the army modernize its doctrine. During this time, he became a key planner and writer in the War Department, commanded the 15th Regiment in the Legation Cities and taught the at the Army War College until 1927. Having being promoted to lieutenant colonel, he was appointed as assistant commandant of the Infantry School at Fort Benning, where he appointed Edwin F. Harding in charge of the school's publication. He'd be posted on different Infantry regiments until being promoted to colonel in 1933 and was promoted to his current rank of Brigadier General in late 1935 due to fear of desertion of several important members of the officer corps in case of 'internal instability'. Regardless, he is widely considered one of the best planners of the United States Army and is widely respected within the General Staff.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Born from a Democrat father and a Republican mother, Marshall has become a politically tolerant man, both publicly and privately."
WCC_HENRY_H_ARNOLD_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W June 25, 1886, in Gladwyne, Pennsylvania, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Henry Harley "Hap" Arnold, a member of the distinguished American Arnold dynasty from which several politicians and military officers were part of, signed up for West Point when he had just turned 17. While he wanted to join the Cavalry corps, his grades and overall performance in the academy caused him to be assigned to the 29th Infantry Regiment, stationed at the Philippines. In April 1911, he requested a transfer to the Signal Corps, where he completed his instruction as an aviator on May. He'd continue his pioneering work in the air force throughout the late 1910s, and became fascinated by the aircraft developments in the Weltkrieg. During the Twenties, he joined up his colleague William Lendrum Mitchell to fight for an independent air force, which lead to Mitchell being court-martialed. Arnold stood, along with other renowned airmen, in defence of Mitchell but failed to win the trial. Arnold would continue to fight for an independent air force, trying to sway congressmen and recruit pilots to his cause, until he was sent to Fort Riley for 'attempting to influence legislation in an improper manner', where he spent the next few years writing books trying to interest young people in the air force. He'd return in 1928 to enter the Army's Command and General Staff School, from where he graduated in 1929. He'd continue changing posts in the American army until 1935, where he was assigned with the General Headquarters Air Force, the closest thing to an independent Air Force he had been in all his career, being promoted to Brigadier General in March 2, 1935. With his requests of an independent air force largely refused, Arnold may harbour some resentment against the general staff..."
WCC_CLARENCE_HUEBNER_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W November 24, 1888, in Bushton, Kansas, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Clarence Ralph Huebner was born into a poor farming family, and so he was unable to afford joining the military academy outright. Instead, he enlisted as a private for the Army, serving in the 18th Infantry Regiment for nearly seven years and reaching the rank of Sergeant by 1916. He took part in the Pancho Villa Expedition, performing remarkably and earning the rank of Second Lieutenant, after which he was sent to the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth.

Warren. However, he did poorly and was dismissed from the academy in just one semester. His mother managed to convince the Senator to appoint him again the next year, but he dropped out, and while the Senator tried to appoint him for a third time the following year, he was rejected by the academy itself. Instead, Fredendall attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and undeterred by his experience in West Point, he took the officer's qualifying exam in 1906, achieving the highest grade of all the applicants. On February 13, 1907, he was finally commissioned as an infantry second lieutenant. Lloyd would then spend the rest of the decade working in several of the army's overseas schools, where he built a reputation of being an excellent teacher, trainer and administrator of troops. Like many other officers, he filled a series of staff and garrison duties in the United States during the twenties. He became both an instructor and student at the U.S. Army Infantry School, graduating in 1923 with distinction from the U.S. Army Command and General Staff School and graduating from the U.S. Army War College.

WCC_WALTER_KRUEGER_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W 26 January 1881, in Flatow, West Prussia, German Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§W Walter Krueger emigrated to the United States with his mother and his two siblings after his father's death in 1890. He enlisted in the United States Army in 1898 to fight the Spanish-American War with the 2nd United States Volunteer Infantry Regiment, reaching the rank of sergeant during the campaign. He re-enlisted for the Philippine-American War and joined the 12th Infantry Regiment, where he fought under the command of General Arthur MacArthur against the Insurrecto rebels. In 1901, he was finally commissioned as a second lieutenant and posted with the 30th Infantry Regiment in Marinduque until it was transferred back to the United States in 1903. While his unit did mostly garrison duties, Krueger attended the Infantry-Cavalry School and the Command and General Staff College, graduating in 1904 and 1907 respectively. After a second tour in the Philippines, he was assigned to the Department of Languages until 1914, and with the outbreak of the Weltkrieg, Krueger was offered a post as an observer with the German Army, but refused and was posted with the 10th Regiment of the National Guard.

In late 1918, Krueger accepted to be an observer in Germany, where he was able to come into contact with the top-of-the-line German tactics, which Krueger would carry home when he returned to America in 1920. He was then posted to the Infantry School at Fort Benning, where he began teaching the basics of German Squad tactics to the eager staff, being promoted to major for his work. He'd continue perfecting his abilities, assisting the Army War College and graduating in 1922, and then leaving once more Germany, where he tried to foster good relations between the two countries' general staffs, but failing due to the hostile political climate of Germany towards the US. Krueger would then be assigned to the War Plans Division of the War Department General Staff, being one of the main engineers of the War Plan Blue, a hypothetical plan in case of another civil within the US. He was promoted to colonel in 1932, and later to Brigadier General for his new involvement in the War Plans Division."

In his second year, he was nominated for West Point, and while he performed excellently in the drill procedures at West Point, his academic performance was so bad that he was forced to repeat his first year. Despite all setbacks, he graduated as a cavalry second lieutenant in 1909 and was assigned with the 15th Cavalry Regiment. In 1912, his athletic skills made him the army's choice to represent the United States for the first modern Pentathlon in the Stockholm Olympic games, ranking fifth out of forty two participants. With the launching of the punitive expedition, Patton became Pershing's Aide-de-Camp during the largely unsuccessful expedition, but this strengthened ties between them and Patton became an almost permanent member of his staff and was promoted to Captain soon enough. He was promoted to Major in June 31, 1920 and began taking an interest in the Weltkrieg’s use of mechanized warfare. In 1923 he'd graduate from the Cavalry's Field Officer's Course, from the Command and General Staff College in 1924 and the Army War College in 1932. During the protests of the Bonus Army, Patton had a major falling out with MacArthur, after which Patton has vocally opposed his colleague constantly. While his friend Eisenhower tends to mediate between the two, Patton has been forced by the general staff to remain as a lieutenant colonel despite having all the traits and qualifications of a brigadier general.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Has displayed strong racist views in public."
