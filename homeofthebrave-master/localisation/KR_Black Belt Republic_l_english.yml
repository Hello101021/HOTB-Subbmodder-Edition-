BBR_national_populist_party_desc:0 "The Nation of Islam is a radical black nationalist group best known for following a highly unorthodox and racialist variant of Islam that claims the white race was created by a mad scientist named Yakub and that the black race is the chosen people of Allah which has resulted in them being rejected by virtually every other branch of Islam as being heretics. Their leader, Elijah Muhammad, claims that NOI founder Wallace Fard Muhammad was God himself and that Elijah Muhammad is his appointed prophet on Earth, with Fard's sudden dissaparence leaving Elijah in charge. Outside the NOI Fard's dissaparence is a source of a multitude of conspiracy theories but nonetheless the NOI's paramilitary prowess, appeals to racial purity, guarantees of a minimum standard of living for members and promise to end all threats to Black Americans has made it one of the most powerful, and extreme, far-right organizations in Black America despite its odd nature."

### Ideas ###
BBR_great_depression:0 "The Great Depression"
BBR_great_depression_desc:0 "Since the collapse of the New York Stock Market in 1925, the United States has been gripped by the Great Depression. In addition to the massive economic woes plaguing America from this never-ending crisis, the Great Depression has given energy to both Long and Reed as they campaign against one another and the establishment."

BBR_black_monday:0 "The Great Depression"
BBR_black_monday_desc:0 "The Great Depression which has been gripping America for over a decade looked to be slowly recovering under the Hoover administration, though nowhere near fast enough. However, the recent collapse of the Berlin Stock Market has just made the Great Depression even worse. Only God and the next president know when this can be over."

BBR_black_monday2:0 "The Great Depression"
BBR_black_monday2_desc:0 "The Great Depression which has been gripping America for over a decade looked to be slowly recovering under the Hoover administration, though nowhere near fast enough. However, the recent collapse of the Berlin Stock Market has just made the Great Depression even worse. Only God and the next president know when this can be over."

BBR_political_crisis:0 "Political Crisis"
BBR_political_crisis_desc:0 "The United States is in crisis. The Great Depression, which has been ravaging our nation for over a decade, has still not let up. Popular desperation has allowed the far-left Socialist Party of America and the far-right America First Party to gain strength in recent years. Others look to MacArthur and the Army as a way to solve both the depression and radicalization. Many worry that the United States could descend into civil war should our current situation not soon be resolved, or a radical presidential candidate win in the upcoming 1936 Elections."

BBR_civil_war_aftermath_idea:0 "Recovering from the Civil War"
BBR_civil_war_aftermath_idea_desc:0 "While we may have won the Civil War, our country is in ruins. Most people are forced to barter; electrity, running water, and other basic services barely function; and millions are starving or ill, especially the thousands and thousands of orphans."
BBR_civil_war_aftermath_idea2:0 "Slight Recovery from the Civil War"
BBR_civil_war_aftermath_idea2_desc:0 "While we may have stopped the cholera epidemics and famines, most of the country is still on fire. The only place one can find any modicum of stability is the heavily guarded military depots containing newly-delivered famine relief aid and medicine."
BBR_civil_war_aftermath_idea3:0 "Partial Recovery from the Civil War"
BBR_civil_war_aftermath_idea3_desc:0 "The cities have returned to some level of stability, and currency is starting to come back into use as bartering fades. The mass graves are now covered in saplings and flowers as the nation slowly claws itself back from collapse."
BBR_civil_war_aftermath_idea4:0 "Advancing Recovery from the Civil War"
BBR_civil_war_aftermath_idea4_desc:0 "Government-run agencies have started to put people back to work, and some respectable businesses have reopened. The threat of mass starvation has passed, though it is not uncommon to see small hordes of orphans and elderly rooting through trash in the cities."
BBR_civil_war_aftermath_idea5:0 "Nearly-Full Recovery from the Civil War"
BBR_civil_war_aftermath_idea5_desc:0 "The scars of the war, visible just months ago, have largely faded from the country. Factories have re-opened, and trains, busses, and other forms of public transportation have started running with some regularity. America has nearly returned to its pre-war standard of living."

BBR_socialist_resistance2:0 "Strong Socialist Resistance"
BBR_socialist_resistance2_desc:0 "Our initial counter-terrorism efforts are showing some promise, but the Socialist resistance groups are tough nuts to crack. Some peripheral terrorists have been arrested, and a few safehouses raided, but this has had little impact."
BBR_socialist_resistance3:0 "Weakened Socialist Resistance"
BBR_socialist_resistance3_desc:0 "We have succeeded in destroying some main safehouses, and arresting some key ringleaders, but a few notable terrorists remain at large. Analyists still expect a more bombings and attacks, but nothing on the magnitute of the first months of our occupation."

The party leadership of both e Republicans and Democrats disagree, saying that the Electoral College was the only thing that kept the United States from totally dissolving in 1936.

This avenue was also pursued by the syndicalist aligned International Labor Defence, who countered the NAACP for a decade in a competition for the hearts of black voters. Seeing no other option and being unwilling to ever compromise with socialists, NAACP leader Walter Francis White has decided to cooperate with the FBI in an anti-socialist puiblic relations campaign. Whether this truly motivates civil rights or further dilutes the current remains to be seen."

bbr.156.t:0 "Division Over Big Business Support"
bbr.156.d:0 "It is known by most Democrats that economic reform is necessary to preserve American integrity, to this end Democrats differ on the agency the government must take towards existing industries that are ailing. A proposed civil works program to electrify the Southwest using hydroelectric power hit a snag as Democrats could not agree on the role of public works in the marketplace. The Works would be able to undercut private electricity companies because it would be able to cross state borders and build dams on public land. Conservative Democrats oppose such intrusions as these, saying that it violates states’ rights to govern trade. More liberal-minded Democrats hold fast that the necessity and potential of Public Works outweigh the risks."

bbr.157.t:0 "President Honors Gunnar Myrdal"
bbr.157.d:0 "The book An American Dilemma was recently published by Swedish economist Gunnar Myrdal. It is an examination of the connection between race and idealism and his thesis on the American Creed. Myrdal was funded by the Carnegie Institute and was chosen for his ambivalence towards American politics. Therefore this report carries with it support from many institutions, and Myrdal, as a result, is invited to the White House for dinner. With him is Ralph Bunche, diplomat and collaborator on this influential book."

bbr.158.t:0 "Division over Fair Deal Doctrine"
bbr.158.d:0 "The need for the Fair Deal to remedy America's many economic issues is agreed upon in the Republican Party, despite the old guard within the party insisting that Hoover handled it the best he could. An important provision in the Fair Deal is the intervention of federal policy to regulate the market and even prevent bank failure. Several high profile Republicans like Robert Taft oppose stretching executive power even if it could benefit the economy. To counter, Quentin Roosevelt has stated the role of the President to ensure the health of the American people extends to their economy."
bbr.158.a:0 "Taft's opinion is overruled."
bbr.158.b:0 "Quentin's opinion is overruled."

bbr.159.t:0 "The Conservative Manifesto"
bbr.159.d:0 "A subgroup of Democrats met a month ago to discuss the future of the party. Among these are Strom Thurmond and Happy Chandler, long serving congressmen that resist the drift of the Democratic Party towards the political centre. Their Conservative Manifesto is an argument against the long-term effects of the Fair Deal and a restoration of the rights of states. The question though is what shall the Party as a wholes reaction be to this so-called Conservative Manifesto"
bbr.159.a:0 "The Party supports the manifesto."

bbr.161.d:0 "'This morning I came, I saw and I was conquered, as everyone would be who sees for the first time this great feat of mankind. Ten years ago the place where we are gathered was a sparse, forbidding desert. In the bottom of a gloomy canyon, whose precipitous walls rose to a height of more than a thousand feet, flowed a turbulent, dangerous river. The mountains on either side of the canyon were difficult of access with neither road nor trail, and their rocks were protected by neither trees nor grass from the blazing heat of the sun. The site of Boulder City was a cactus-covered waste. The transformation wrought here in these years is a twentieth-century marvel.'

bbr.164.d:0 "One of the Progressive Party's Policies it has sought for some time was a nationalization of the countries Railroads. Now that they have power, the question is how exactly shall railway nationalization go. Congress is debating between two different proposals for how this shall be implemented.

Which version shall Congress go with?"

BBR_DOUGLAS_MACARTHUR_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W 26 January, 1880, in Little Rock, Arkansas, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Douglas 'Big Chief' MacArthur, born from a long family line of military men, graduated from West Point as an Engineer Corps second lieutenant in 1903 with the highest grade in the academy's history. In 1904, he was promoted to first lieutenant and travelled to the Philippines in order to help his father with the construction of their headquarters. Through his father's influence, MacArthur quickly became a military advisor to President Theodore Roosevelt until 1908, where he took command of an engineer company in Fort Leavenworth, reaching the rank of Captain in 1911. All these high profile postings allowed him to join the American General Staff in 1912, at the young age of 32. MacArthur took part in the occupation of Veracruz, learning Spanish in a matter of weeks and taking part in several small skirmishes with the rebels. He returned to America in 1919, when he was assigned as the Director of the United States' Military Academy at West Point. In 1922, he returned to the Philippines, this time to inspect the island's defence status, and having to intervene personally to end mutiny of Philippino scouts. With his promotion to Major General in 1925, his notoriety only grew and grew, being sent to the 1928 Olympic games in the Netherlands to head the American Olympic Committee. However, MacArthur was also forced to comply with orders he didn't agree with, like the court martial of Brigadier General Billy Mitchell, which MacArthur has called 'one of the most distasteful orders I ever received'. During the 'Bonus March', MacArthur was forced, under President Hoover's orders, to put down the 'Bonus Army' despite MacArthur's agreeing with the protestors' demands. He has since then become the highest ranking American Officer, although he has had a troubled relation with the government's executive branch.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Born from a family that fought in the Civil War, MacArthur is willing to do whatever is necessary to keep America as a united, great and free country."
BBR_DWIGHT_EISENHOWER_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W October 14, 1890, in Denison, Texas, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Dwight David 'Ike' Eisenhower, a fan of military history since a young age, applied for both West Point and Annapolis in 1910, being accepted in the former after the highest ranking candidate failed the physical requirement in 1911. He graduated in 1915 along with Omar Bradley and was almost discharged due to a leg injury, but West Point's chief medical officer interceded with the War Department and obtained a commission for him. Eisenhower would be posted with the 19th Infantry Regiment in the Mexican Border and reached the rank of Captain in 1917. He was transferred to Fort Benning in late 1918, where he remained training with the Camp Polk Tank school until the 1919 Motor Transport Corps convoy. 'Ike' was promoted to Major in 1920. His interest in armored warfare only grew and grew, and quickly joined Patton's and Van Voorhis in their requests of increased funding for a mechanization program. In 1924, he was sent to Panama, where he served under General Fox Conner, who decided to tutor 'Ike' into philosophy, military history and military theory and was selected in 1925 for the Command and General Staff College, graduating first in a class of 245 officers. Conner would help 'Ike' to get into the War College, becoming one of the youngest students of the academy and receiving the praise of General Pershing himself. After his graduation, he was assigned to the Army War College, and then served as executive officer to Major General George Van Horn Moseley, Assistant Secretary of War, from 1929 to 1933. Since then he has served as chief military aide of General Douglas MacArthur, accompanying him to the Philippines, where he served as assistant military adviser to the Philippine government. Since then, he has become MacArthur's undisputed second in command, and while their personalities tend to clash often, many claim that their skills complement each other."
BBR_OMAR_BRADLEY_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W February 12, 1893, in Clark, Missouri, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Omar Nelson 'Brad' Bradley signed up to join the United States Military Academy in 1911, where he finished second in the placements for the appointments. However, the winner couldn't accept the congressional appointment for the academy, so it was granted to Bradley. He graduated in 1915 and was commissioned as an infantry second lieutenant, and becoming a close friend of another graduate of the same class, Dwight D. Eisenhower. He was assigned to the 14th Infantry Regiment stationed in the Mexican border, reaching the rank of Captain in 1917 and being transferred to guard the copper mines in Butte, Montana, remaining in garrison duties for the rest of the decade. From 1920 to 1924, he worked as a math teacher in West Point, reaching the rank of Major in 1924 and undergoing the advanced infantry course at Fort Benning. Bradley later studied at the U.S. Army Command and General Staff School, graduating in 1929 and serving as an instructor in tactics at the U.S. Army Infantry School, where he met and established good relations with Lt.Col. George Marshall. He taught in West Point from 1929 to 1934, where he took a break to study at the U.S. Army War College, reaching the rank of lieutenant colonel. With the fears that the War Plan Blue might be executed in the near future, Bradley was first promoted to Brigadier General and then to Field Marshal along with Eisenhower by MacArthur's own request.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Largely considered one of the most dependable generals of the US Army, Marshall once described him as 'A quiet, unassuming and capable man, with sound common sense. He has an absolute dependability. Give him a job and forget it' and that reputation may have helped to speed up his promotion."
BBR_GEORGE_MARSHALL_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W December 21, 1880, in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W George Catlett Marshall Jr. began his military career in the Virginia Military Institute in 1900, graduating in 1902 as a second lieutenant of the United States Army. Marshall was posted in the Philippines during the Philippine-American war, as well as helping to contain guerrilla operations in the area post-war. During the Weltkrieg, Marshall was sent to France, along with many other American officers as observers, where he was promoted to Captain for his observations. After working as aide-de-camp of General Pershing for a short time in 1919, he began being assigned to several positions in the army, mainly to relay his experience in the Weltkrieg to more inexperienced officers as well as helping the army modernize its doctrine. During this time, he became a key planner and writer in the War Department, commanded the 15th Regiment in the Legation Cities and taught the at the Army War College until 1927. Having being promoted to lieutenant colonel, he was appointed as assistant commandant of the Infantry School at Fort Benning, where he appointed Edwin F. Harding in charge of the school's publication. He'd be posted on different Infantry regiments until being promoted to colonel in 1933 and was promoted to his current rank of Brigadier General in late 1935 due to fear of desertion of several important members of the officer corps in case of 'internal instability'. Regardless, he is widely considered one of the best planners of the United States Army and is widely respected within the General Staff.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Born from a Democrat father and a Republican mother, Marshall has become a politically tolerant man, both publicly and privately."
BBR_HENRY_H_ARNOLD_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W June 25, 1886, in Gladwyne, Pennsylvania, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Henry Harley "Hap" Arnold, a member of the distinguished American Arnold dynasty from which several politicians and military officers were part of, signed up for West Point when he had just turned 17. While he wanted to join the Cavalry corps, his grades and overall performance in the academy caused him to be assigned to the 29th Infantry Regiment, stationed at the Philippines. In April 1911, he requested a transfer to the Signal Corps, where he completed his instruction as an aviator on May. He'd continue his pioneering work in the air force throughout the late 1910s, and became fascinated by the aircraft developments in the Weltkrieg. During the Twenties, he joined up his colleague William Lendrum Mitchell to fight for an independent air force, which lead to Mitchell being court-martialed. Arnold stood, along with other renowned airmen, in defence of Mitchell but failed to win the trial. Arnold would continue to fight for an independent air force, trying to sway congressmen and recruit pilots to his cause, until he was sent to Fort Riley for 'attempting to influence legislation in an improper manner', where he spent the next few years writing books trying to interest young people in the air force. He'd return in 1928 to enter the Army's Command and General Staff School, from where he graduated in 1929. He'd continue changing posts in the American army until 1935, where he was assigned with the General Headquarters Air Force, the closest thing to an independent Air Force he had been in all his career, being promoted to Brigadier General in March 2, 1935. With his requests of an independent air force largely refused, Arnold may harbour some resentment against the general staff..."
BBR_CLARENCE_HUEBNER_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W November 24, 1888, in Bushton, Kansas, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Clarence Ralph Huebner was born into a poor farming family, and so he was unable to afford joining the military academy outright. Instead, he enlisted as a private for the Army, serving in the 18th Infantry Regiment for nearly seven years and reaching the rank of Sergeant by 1916. He took part in the Pancho Villa Expedition, performing remarkably and earning the rank of Second Lieutenant, after which he was sent to the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth. He reached the rank of Major before becoming a teacher in the academy from 1929 to 1933.

He was assigned as a Captain of the 1st Cavalry Regiment of the Vermont National Guard until 1916 when he quit military life to focus his energy on his job as an Engineer. This lasted until the National Guard was recalled shortly afterwards for the Pancho Villa Expedition, however, he didn’t see any action there. Wanting to further his military career, he joined the Army Field Artillery School at Fort Sill in 1921, graduating the next year and remaining as an instructor until 1926. He was then assigned to the command of Battery 'D' in the 24th Field Artillery Regiment at Fort Stotsenburg in the Philippines. He remained there until 1928 where he was assigned to the 18th Field Artillery Regiment in Fort Riley. He later attended the Army Command and General Staff School in 1932, graduating two years later and went to Harvard University as an instructor of the ROTC, reaching the rank of Major in 1935.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Currently undergoing training at the Army War College and is expected to graduate in early 1937."
