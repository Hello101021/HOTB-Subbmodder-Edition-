TEX_Devers_plan3:0 "Devers Reform Plan"

### Huey Long Path ###
TEX_new_washington:0 "The New Washington"
TEX_new_washington_desc:0 "The new American seat of government will throw off the old shackles of Capitoline tradition and rebuild itself as a defensible and secure location for the three branches to seat power. Boulevards are now too wide for barricades, structures are now supplied with emergency power, and shelters are guaranteed for residents."
TEX_to_the_victor:0 "To the Victor"
TEX_to_the_victor_desc:0 "It is over, the enemies of the American People have been felled and we control their lands. It is time to take possession of the enemies military assets, placing the AFP in charge of these valuable resources. Our control over the states will set the groundwork for the political future of America."
TEX_root_out_out_traitors:0 "Root out Traitors"
TEX_root_out_out_traitors_desc:0 "Despite their armies being defeated extremists still populate the American states we have brought justice to. We need to root out those whom will never be satisfied with democracy under Huey Long, namely the militant cells that threaten the American populace at every turn."
TEX_reconcile_the_left:0 "Reconcile the Left"
TEX_reconcile_the_left_desc:0 "We can never excuse the CSA's attempt to overthrow the American Constitution or their anti-American syndicalism but the grievances of the workers that were fooled into supporting them are fair. We should appeal to the Independent Leagues and AFL whom desire economic reform, knowing they wanted to make peace with Huey but were prevented from doing so by the most extreme radicals we will now bleed support from."
TEX_afp_alone:0 "AFP Alone"
TEX_afp_alone_desc:0 "Compromise. That was the word used by useless politicians whom nearly handed our country over to extremists. The AFP and the nation more generally is not going to go out of its way to appeal to any of the factions that aligned themselves against the AUS. If they want, let them repent and embrace Longist values on their own but we will not compromise."
TEX_reconcile_the_right:0 "Reconcile the Right"
TEX_reconcile_the_right_desc:0 "There is no mistake that the political right made mistakes in supporting either the Feds or Murray. However their pro-American values and defense of capitalism against socialism is admirable and their machines are too large to hit head on, we should co-opt them with appeals to the cultural conservatives and anti-socialist populism, opening the way to taking the South."
TEX_dismantle_the_dixiecrats:0 "Dismantle the Dixiecrats"
TEX_dismantle_the_dixiecrats_desc:0 "The right-wing Democrats have looked down on Huey since he was a lawyer defending the little man from corporations. Now they wish for us to allow their machines to thrive despite their attempts on the Kingfish's life. Let's see if they are so smug when the radical DWL gets a taste of their own medicine and the regressive Southern machine is wholly replaced by a progressive one."
TEX_black_support:0 "Black Support"
TEX_black_support_desc:0 "With our desire to displace the Old Democrats whole cloth we have gained a more positive reputation with the black population. While Huey has long been ambigious on Civil Rights issues he has suddenly found himself more vocally supporting increased spending on black communities as the expense of the landed elite of the South, leading to a rapid increase in black AFP supporters."
TEX_shake_hands_with_dixie:0 "Shake Hands with Dixie"
TEX_shake_hands_with_dixie_desc:0 "The Old Democrats are finished on a national scale but their machine in the South remains. The Union made a terrible and costly mistake in bothering to oppose it after the Civil War, one we should not repeat. While we will hunt down the irreconciable White Leagers we should cut a deal with the Southern Democrats whom now look to us for protection, promising not to uproot them so long as they do not oppose Long."
TEX_a_new_solid_south:0 "A New Solid South"
TEX_a_new_solid_south_desc:0 "The Southern Democrat machine lost the war and as a result learned its place under Long, whom they are already making appeals to support on the nation level if allowed to maintain their machines in the South and given some autonomy. So long as they weed out radical anti-Longists and pay their share their is no need to further disrupt the South as they are now a reliable voting block and White League opposition is winding down."
TEX_expand_the_minute_men:0 "Expand the Minutemen"
TEX_expand_the_minute_men_desc:0 "In order to preserve the integrity of our armed forces, we must expand the Minutemen into the field of civil protection and border monitoring. The insurgent socialists, White Leagues and MacArthurites don't adhere to the rules of engagement anymore, therefore we must prepare for any level of brutality on their part."
TEX_election_monitoring:0 "Election Monitoring"
TEX_election_monitoring_desc:0 "The only force that can ensure the democratic process is carried out is the Minutemen, who shall be deployed every November to safeguard voting areas from harm. They shall keep an eye to safeguard the voting process for our third-party allies and make sure nothing goes wrong for us."
TEX_destroy_the_klan:0 "Destroy the Klan"
TEX_destroy_the_klan_desc:0 "Hiram Wesley Evans and his cadre of his Grand Wizards are finally arrested and brought to trial for their terroristic actions. Murders, lynchings, and voter intimidation is being brought against this most dangerous group of traitors. With their conviction we have finally pacified the most extreme that sought to destroy the American First Party."
TEX_ensure_loyalty:0 "Ensure Loyalty"
TEX_ensure_loyalty_desc:0 "Members of Congress have devised a way to establish a baseline of trust in our democratic system that is sorely needed. The so-named Fish Act would require every party representative, labor union leader and public servant to sign an affidavit stating that they will never aid the CSA or MacArthur junta."
TEX_reward_loyalty:0 "Reward Loyalty"
TEX_reward_loyalty_desc:0 "The Fish Act's critics rightfully stated that there was no incentive for officials to sign the affidavits. In response a second Act is passed to provide compensation for the time spent in the public service during the Civil War that was postponed by the Federalists. This back-pay would require signing the aforementioned affidavit, of course."
TEX_the_american_progress:0 "The American Progress"
TEX_veteran_benefits:0 "Veteran Benefits"
TEX_national_political_machine:0 "National Political Machine"
TEX_national_political_machine_desc:0 "Executive acts have been used to create agencies to serve the American people in the past, so long as it does not intrude into state sovereignty. In the past, this power has led to corruption from corporate interests. The president is, however, incorruptible. Turning the tables against the monopolies and grafters is his promise to America."
TEX_new_democracy:0 "New Democracy"
TEX_new_democracy_desc:0 "New Democracy is a new social contract between the American people and leadership. New Democracy promises a politician that will work in his constituents’ interests through adversity, even through violence. Loyalty to your constituents will be rewarded until every man is a king."
TEX_peoples_commission:0 "People's Commission"
TEX_peoples_commission_desc:0 "Inspired by the judicial districts of Louisiana, the president has created a para-legal representative entity called the Peoples Commission. The Peoples Commission is a nonpartisan forum for public discussion that will allow the AFP to directly communicate with the American people and hear issues that politicians will not report on."
TEX_every_man_a_king:0 "Every Man a King"
TEX_every_man_a_king_desc:0 "What began as a dream and lifted from a motivational book by Orison Swett Mardin, Every Man a King is now a political reality.

TEX_for_the_poor_man:0 "For the Poor Man"
TEX_for_the_poor_man_desc:0 "Now the president has brought to Congress legislation to furnish a homestead allowance of 1/3rd the average wealth. A guaranteed annual income of $2000 and old-age pensions is ready to be distributed to loyal Americans. Until such a time when the proper income tax changes are made, these benefits are coming out of the National Treasury."
TEX_populist_education:0 "Education for the Masses"
TEX_populist_education_desc:0 "Across this great nation there are millions more children struggling to resume normal life and facing a future no better than that of their parents without education.

TEX_wealth_ceiling:0 "Wealth Ceiling"
TEX_road_map_for_the_future:0 "Roadmap for the Future"
TEX_road_map_for_the_future_desc:0 "The expenses the president has taken out for Every Man a King requires a fundamentally different means of tax collection and public financing to sustain itself. Therefore, President Long has laid out a road-map to plan out spending for the next four years of his term and milestones that America should cross."
TEX_townsend_plan:0 "Townsend Plan"
TEX_founders_legacy:0 "Legacy of Founders and Scripture"
TEX_national_youth_adminstration:0 "National Youth Administration"
TEX_national_youth_adminstration_desc:0 "The orphans of the Civil War need not only education to uplift themselves, but discipline as well. A visit to Boys Town near Omaha Nebraska has inspired President Long to create the National Youth Administration. A work training and activism group for young Americans that gives orphans a place to stay and trains them in important life skills."
TEX_share_the_wealth:0 "Share the Wealth"
TEX_share_the_wealth_desc:0 "It has come time for the rich that helped plunge America into civil war to pay. No person will be allowed to accumulate more than 300 times the annual income. Incomes are capped at $1 million, and inheritances capped at $5.1 million. President Long will prove the newspapers who decried him wrong."
TEX_imperial_presidency:0 "Imperial Presidency"
TEX_imperial_presidency_desc:0 "With traitors uprooted and exposed, public opinion polls show an overwhelming support for President Long's re-election. Unrestrained by pressure to conform or be threatened by members within the AFP, the president has begun what many are calling his 'imperial presidency'. The two-term limit is respectfully discarded until a lesser man is in charge."
TEX_fire_with_fire:0 "Fight Fire with Fire"
TEX_fire_with_fire_desc:0 "The ideological fight against the political and social enemies of America has been done thus far with welfare and incentives. Now President Long is ready to pull punches against the social resistance to Share the Wealth. We must use every measure possible to stop the boat of the nation from turning over."
TEX_commodity_controls:0 "Commodity Controls"
TEX_commodity_controls_desc:0 "The farmers of this nation have been squeezed for too long despite their goods fueling the rest of America! We shall implement a new Department of Economics with stronger powers to take a pro-consumer and pro-farmer stance, starting with nationalizing utility companies that took an anti-AUS stance and purchasing agricultural goods."
TEX_farm_subsidies:0 "Farm Subsidies"
TEX_farm_subsidies_desc:0 "We can save the common farmer with the proper injection of good old American cash. The government will now subsidize farmers so they will not lose money growing the goods America needs and double down on purchasing excess goods for stockpiling during prosperous times."
TEX_keynesian_economics:0 "Keynesian Economics"
TEX_keynesian_economics_desc:0 "The government must ensure the American people never again suffers as they did under the Great Depression. Hoover's inability to rescue the economy nearly destroyed USA so we will follow the lead of economic progressives in adopting the recommendations of John Maynard Keynes to use a looser fiscal policy as a tool to fight unemployment."
TEX_scientific_board:0 "Scientific Board"
TEX_scientific_board_desc:0 "The Farmer-Labor Political Federation and the AFP shall enter a symbiotic relationship in embracing scientific planning for basic utilities and commodities while rejecting the radicals desire to do this for other goods.

TEX_coops_plan:0 "Co-op Plan"
TEX_coops_plan_desc:0 "A popular concept in both wings of the AFP, farm coops allow for farmers to share their resources with one another.

TEX_radical_economics:0 "Labor Economics"
TEX_radical_economics_desc:0 "We can't keep relying on traditional economic systems to serve us by keeping them on life support.

TEX_banks_for_america:0 "Banks for America"
TEX_banks_for_america_desc:0 "It is long time to adopt the Popular Control Plan for banking! A Central Bank will be created that will have control over the banking industry, with a board of directors directly elected by the people. 'Officers' for local banks will likewise be directly elected to control for parts of their bank not directly regaulted by the Central Bank. The bankers will do what they are supposed to, run the banks, and nothing more, as the people decide the rest."
TEX_strike_oil:0 "Strike Oil"
TEX_strike_oil_desc:0 "We can finally strike down Standard Oil, a company that decided to side with MacArthur and Oligarchs over the people.

Legislative elections and a less economically-influential justice system will be reimplemented as seperate entities from the executive branch."
### Pelley Path ###
TEX_christian_party_victory:0 "Christian Party Victory"
TEX_christian_party_victory_desc:0 "In an outcome that has shocked both the nation and onlookers abroad, Huey Long and the America First Party have lost the first elections in America since the conclusion of the civil war. William Dudley Pelley, chairman of the Christian Party and Chief of the Silver Legion, has won both a slim majority in congress and secured the highest office in the land."
TEX_defend_democracy:0 "Defend Democracy"
TEX_defend_democracy_desc:0 "Before his election the President was called many things. A legionnaire, a syndicalist, a populist tyrant and so much more. Yet he has always claimed to be dedicated to upholding the American republic and the values on which it was founded. We shall implement a judicial bill that will affirm our committment to trial by jury, the powers of the court and increase penalties for corruption."
TEX_organize_new_elections:0 "Organize New Elections"
TEX_organize_new_elections_desc:0 "Despite the steady rebuilding of our great nation some express concern that the AFP was more concerned with its own power than restoring America. In a bid both to distance ourselves from Long and increase our own popularity it has been decided that the federal government will ensure proper oversight for all state-level elections and remove those who won their seats through legally dubious methods."
TEX_fight_the_terrorists:0 "Fight the Terrorists"
TEX_fight_the_terrorists_desc:0 "Despite the end of the civil war, fighting has not entirely ceased. Ideologues still cling to their beliefs and occasionally strike at us before slinking back into the shadows. President Pelley shall order not only law enforcement to begin a nationwide crackdown to root out these murderers but the Silver Legion will be deployed to supplement their efforts. America is no place for cowardly traitors!"
TEX_reform_the_fbi:0 "Reform the FBI"
TEX_reform_the_fbi_desc:0 "It was inevitable that government agencies like the FBI would be shattered by the civil war. Despite their hostility to Pelley in the 1930’s the President sees the need and utility of such an organization. Once freed from the grip of Hoover and his gang of sycophants and given proper oversight they will help ensure the wellbeing of the republic and the upholding of our great laws!"
TEX_outlaw_syndicalism:0 "Outlaw Syndicalism"
TEX_outlaw_syndicalism_desc:0 "The SPA’s attempt to destroy our nation has cemented President Pelley's suspicions that these traitors cannot be allowed to legally spread their filth. Effective immediately all Marxist, Syndicalist, Bolshevist and other vocal revolutionary left groups will be considered seditious and effectively outlawed. Some may complain that this is deeply authoritarian, but sometimes such measures are needed."
TEX_political_rehabilitation:0 "Political Rehabilitation"
TEX_political_rehabilitation_desc:0 "Despite the inherent evil of their leaders do we not see the average syndicalist is simply a man who wishes to have bread on his table? Thus we will direct the Department of Justice to begin drafting lists of currently imprisoned (non-leading) radicals and offer them clemency in return for a renunciation of their former beliefs and a written statement to never again support such causes."
TEX_national_command_structure:0 "National Command Structure"
TEX_national_command_structure_desc:0 "Despite our recent political success infighting is abundant within the Legion. Local commanders complain of inconsistent orders, accountants skim off the top and desertion becomes increasingly commonplace. This is unacceptable and damaging not only to the Legion but to America as a whole. The President will call a meeting of top Silver Legionaries to formalize a better command system."
TEX_form_new_councils_of_safety:0 "Build Silver Lodges"
TEX_form_new_councils_of_safety_desc:0 "The Silver Lodges were a grand idea devised by Pelley and his top commanders before the civil war wherein the Legion would would purchase lands on which to build command centers inorder to facilitate recruitment. With many Lodges destroyed in the fighting we should further our commitment to the Legion and direct the treasury to allocate funds to units so that they may build new headquarters."
TEX_wrangle_congress:0 "Wrangle Congress"
TEX_wrangle_congress_desc:0 "Despite the Christian Party having won the election President Pelley has still found the politicians to be a bickering and gridlocked sort. Whilst his legislation does pass it often takes too much time and requires far too much politicking for Pelley's liking. The solution to this is clear; utilize the radio as our new soapbox and decry those shysters who would hold up America’s future for their petty games."
TEX_pdol:0 "Expand the Department of Labor"
TEX_pdol_desc:0 "Pelley gained most of his following from his radical economic proposals foremost and the time has come to begin implementing his grand ideas. This monumental effort will begin with a vast expansion of the Department of Labor, in each and every county across our nation a DoL office will be opened.

Exhausted by dictating President Long's orders, allies within the Prohibition Party and old Democrats have come today to deliver a more radical proposal for their constituents. Pork barreling together is a bill for veteran back pay, and a proposal for the Prohibition Amendment. Prohibition is popular with conservative protestants in the South, but is seen as tyrannical by the so-called Wet States in the North and West. Unfortunately, the big tent politics of the AFP mean these bills can only pass together or not at all. The final decision lies with Huey Long."

The Secret Service, having been decimated by the war, must seek the aid of the FBI if they are to ever find President Long alive. American Legion national commander, George Van Horn Moseley, has announced he will guide the country until a proper leader is found, ensuring syndicalism is uprooted from the country.

Hugo Black responded to the press by profusely apologizing, and saying that his membership was just perfunctory in order to get elected in Alabama.

A group of concerned citizens, including hundreds of veterans and poor from Norther Louisiana have gathered in Baton Rouge, claiming that Earl Long has withheld their income and benefits. Governor Earl tried to speak to the crowd, claiming that the funds have yet to arrive from the capitol, and to disperse until that day. The protesters, many of whom were black veterans, began chanting for Earl's resignation. While accounts differ about what happened next, anywhere from 20-50 people lie dead among the protesters. It now lies with President Huey to pick up the pieces. Governor Earl is appealing to his brother to help him with damage control.

The book continues with the revelation that all the characters, both white and black, are mixed race, and the entire principle of racial supremacy collapses.

This is largely due to the sensationalist takes on Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker, a couple apparently leading the gang and whom are often called Bonnie and Clyde for short. The activities of the whole gang involve mainly robberies sometimes even of banks, but increasingly members of law enforcement are getting gunned down, partly due to the heavy firepower the gang is packing.

Certainly this does not make him the greater evil to us nor are we to him, leading to him asking for protection. His machine would undermine the AFP power and not be wholly popular but would provide the AUS as a whole with greater resources, men who could be recruited in his territory and assistance from Pendergast's organized crime allies who could make our lives easier and CAR's more difficult. On the other hand we could just run AFP candidates in his territory and scare off him and his ally mobster Charles Carrollo by threatening to charge them should they not leave. What should we do?"

This makes them potentially useful allies as they can help disrupt activities within the CAR if provided funding and perhaps even giving its leader Harry Leland Mitchell a seat on our cabinet. However, some in the party are reluctant to do so due to it being widely known the STFU has heavy sympathies with some of the Combined Syndicates of America despite not being based out of their territory.

unionstate.30.d:0 "Huey's main ally in Congress and now in the AUS has long been the Midwest Progressive and Farmer-Labor organizations despite an occasionally tense relationship due to disagreements with Huey Long's style of populism. However a recent proposal would strengthen this alliance. It comes from Alfred Mitchell Bingham, a radical activist and lead editor of the periodical Common Sense, is supportive of progressivism, the AFP and the right-wing of the CSA and is responsible for running the American Farmer-Labor Federation. The AFLF is made up of middle-class activists organizing mainly for the working class and which has connections with the AFP, the Progressives and even Bellaymists in the CSA. Despite the Federations flexibility it's stance on economic issues revolves around economic planning when it comes to agrarian goods and recently Bingham and other members of the Federation have begun to see the AFP as the best possible route to a radical but patriotic future. They have proposed forming the American Commonwealth Co-operative Movement, under which they would openly join the AFP in a political alliance. While this would shore up our support among left-leaning activists and undermine the National Progressive Party has potential competition it could tie us to more left-wing economic policies than some of our party members are comfortable with."

unionstate.3001.t:0 "Second Great Migration"
unionstate.3001.d:0 "Despite the attempts of the COnstitutal American Republic to force black Americans to stay in their territory, an increasingly large number of Black Americans are fleeing to the North and West. The total is likely numbering in at least a million, with many seeking to settle in our territory due to its obvious proximity. In particular, the urban regions of Texas are seeing an inflow of Black migrants but the machines representing many whites, particularly the questionably loyal local Democratic Parties as well as part of the AFP, are demanding we take away their right to vote so as to not threaten their political supremacy. White populists such as Gerald L.K. Smith suggest also stopping anymore blacks from entering so as to not threaten the white working class. However, much of the AFP and Progressives disagree with this and alongside our generals see an opportunity for recruitment and potential factory workers. They recommend allowing the migrants to settle and recruiting them at once."

unionstate.3002.d:0 "The Regular Democratic Organization is Louisian's political machine for conservative Democrats and are Long's traditional opponents in his home state. Despite this the two have made alliances in the past and with the "Old Regulars" having questionable loyalty to the AUS over CAR or the USA now might be the time to make another such alliance, agreeing not to run AFP candidates in Southern Louisiana in return for them not openly opposing us. Of course, some Old Regulars have already crossed over to the Old Democrats and refuse to support Long, begging the question of whether we should simply "investigate" the organization for corruption and have it basically shut down which would also increase the AFP's hold on the state. Of course, this would push the old money elite even more against Long as well as the most ardent white supremacists."

unionstate.31.t:0 "The Hollywood List"
unionstate.31.d:0 "We know that Hollywood has always acted above the law. It's mere existence in California an attempt to dodge intellectual property laws. Moreover, it is no secret that some artists there had hoped for a syndicalist victory over our great American Republic. Their folly must be exposed and their sedition prosecuted."
unionstate.31.a:0 "We'll film their trials."

unionstate.32.t:0 "Persistence of Antisemitism"
unionstate.32.d:0 "With the great success of Fordism in America, there comes as well some critics of the ideas presented in Ford literature. Especially within the Dearborn Independent, articles describing a massive worldwide conspiracy of Jews has created backlash against Fordism. The public at large is beginning to question Ford's aging logic, and as Ford is not a very public man, his responses to the press have only damned him further. To Ford's critics, including other Committee members, racial rhetoric must be pushed subtly and anonymously. Most of the Committee including [TEX.GetLeader] still agree with Ford's theories, but disagree on the medium to propagate those ideas as to not destabilize the new America's international relations."

unionstate.33.d:0 "Weaving spiders are the many members of the press that continue their fruitless search for Huey Long. Although the FBI has made the best public display of effort possible, there persist some underground press who do not believe syndicalists did the deed. While most pamphlets on this are published anonymously, the FBI have traced their origin, and surprisingly found them to be coming from both the left and right, politically speaking. These conspiracy theorists, as we call them, could destabilize our new government if they continue their publications."

unionstate.34.t:0 "Every Girl a Queen?"
unionstate.34.d:0 "The most delicate part of the Business Plot is upon us. It appears Huey Long's will dictates that, in an event of his injury or incapacitation, his wife Rose Long was to take his post. Many die-hard Long followers have come to Washington, demanding Rose occupy the Presidential Mansion until Huey Long be found. They are met with an equal number of former Federalists who insist Huey Long's running mate, William Lemke, is the constitutionally-correct President. Siding with the constitution as our best defence is perhaps the more prudent path, though it could also be seen as an insult to Huey Long's widow and enflame the anger of the public even further."
unionstate.34.a:0 "Make a public show of sympathy for Rose Long's cause."
unionstate.34.b:0 "The Constitution is not subject to sentiment."

unionstate.35.t:0 "But No One Wears A Crown"
unionstate.35.d.coverup:0 "Finally the Business Plot's master stroke is ready: exhausting and unresolved debates have worn down the willpower of Congress to elect a Vice President with absolute majority. A group of our more trustworthy Senators are ready to bring George Moseley into his own as Vice President, and to then serve as President until Huey is found. This involves a very specific alteration to Article II and the 12th Amendment to allow for Moseley as President Pro Tempore to assume office. Any attempts to uncover the truth behind Huey's disappearance have gone nowhere."
unionstate.35.d.uncovered:0 "Although he was maligned during the war for his almost nihilistic attitude, the journalist Westbrook Pegler has more than redeemed himself to the public today. Through investigative journalism, dodging government goons, and a dedication to facts over his own political reservations, the truth has been uncovered to the public. The underground press has exposed the true killers of Huey Long: his own bodygaurds. The blood money was traced right back to none other than interim president, George Moseley. The whole apparatus of state has moved to arrest Moseley, who implicated the War Powers Committee in what people are calling the 'Business Plot'. These men will be brought to justice, wherever they lay."
unionstate.35.d.scandal:0 "The Business Plot has succeeded, though it has come at great cost. Journalist Westbrook Pegler published an 'expose', accusing Moseley and others of conspiring to have Huey Long killed. Since its publication, Pegler's evidence has been proven flimsy and circumstantial - enough so that George Mosely was, in the end, considered more victim that perpetrator. The scandal has left a lingering taste among the public, but Moseley's allies in Congress were able to prevent any official hearings... and, after months of exhaustive and unresolved depates, have managed to arrange for him to serve as President until Huey is found. This involves a very specific alteration to Article II and the 12th Amendment, to allow for Moseley as President Pro Tempore to assume office."

Passed under Wilson in his vain populist bid to promote insurgent democracy over our Republican system of government. The 22nd Amendment will ensure that this unneeded alteration to our system is repaired and Congress will again be represented in the way the Founding Fathers intended."

unionstate.41.t:0 "Mothers Movement Clashes With Feminists"
unionstate.41.d:0 "One of the least likely sources of support within the America First Party came from Mothers Movements. The Mothers Movements are a group of religiously-minded conservative women who aligned with the radical elements that sought to undermine Huey Long. Now that Huey is long gone, leaders like Alma Bridwell White and Elizabeth Dilling now direct hysteria against suspected socialists. Their marches have also demonstrated a xenophobia against Catholics and blacks. Their position within this new America is tenuous, as the highest members of our government regard the nineteenth amendment with only slightly more respect than the thirteenth through fifteenth."

In his final days in office, Moseley had refused every medical assistance, accusing every one he saw of being Jewish. The Vice President, Charles Lindbergh, was recalled to the capital to be sworn in. With the War Powers Committee in attendance, Charles Lindbergh was sworn in as the official 33rd President of the American Republic, as Moseley was only the interim President for his years in office. American expats have universally condemned the new President just as they did the old."

### Pelley Events ###

unionstate.52.t:0 "Fate of Murphy Ranch"
unionstate.52.d:0 "Now that our Legion reaches from coast to coast, we must revisit our place of final resort Pelley had planned out. In the outskirts of L.A, this compound was built a ranch to sustain the Silver Legion in case of a syndicalist victory. Murphy Ranch, as it is called, now has the ability to become fully operational. Should we continue to fortify the homestead to protect our new Californian brothers? Or should we convert the land into a workplace for our reborn American industry?"

unionstate.52.b:0 "Convert it."

unionstate.53.t:0 "Can You See The Real Pelley?"
unionstate.53.d:0 "Although only known to the highest-ranking members of The Silver Legion, there is a hidden depth in the mind of our Chief Pelley. To his closest friends, Pelley is more than a leader and a friend. He is their political, religious, and moral guide. Until now, a sort of secret doctrine has been hidden from the public at large due to their unwillingness to accept that religious and temporal authority are one and the same. Now that our enlightened leader is well-accepted in this brave new American society, should we go public with some of his more... esoteric ideas? Pelley's handlers, as it is, can barely keep him from exposing his deeper thoughts to the public at large. Is the mystery of Pelley enough for the history books?"
unionstate.53.a:0 "Too many would fear this."
unionstate.53.b:0 "The world is ready."

unionstate.55.t:0 "Rise of Speakeasies"
unionstate.55.d:0 "Despite the overwhelming wave of approval Prohibition received within the loyal Christian community, there were some with reservations. In the cities and up high in the mountains, illegal alcohol production has been reported by our agents. The demon drink is being produced by these moral traitors and is transported overnight to underground bars across the nation. We must stop this affront against our values, and catch the deviants responsible."
unionstate.55.a:0 "Alcoholism must be stamped out."

unionstate.57.t:0 "The Great Lie"
unionstate.57.d:0 "The official record in America has always been biased in favour of the ruling party. Once in office, Thomas Jefferson slandered the memory of the great patriot, John Adams, and fooled subsequent generations into believing his love for Nativism was tyranny. Now we must erase the great lie perpetrated by presidential candidate and Governor of Ohio, Warren G. Harding, to hide his black ancestry. We have the papers to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that Harding's father was a black man and therefore complicit in a worldwide conspiracy against the Commonwealth."

The organisation's shareholders consist of members of the AFP, the Prohibiton Party, and the Southern Tenant Farmers Union. These board members met at 2am, straddling the line between official business and secrecy. William Upshaw, of the Prohibtion Party, brought to the fore President Long's apparent betrayal of his party values. The AFP board members agreed that Long's rejection of a main campaign promise bodes ill for more 'morally-centred' legislation in the future. Francis Townsend, who joined Huey Long in order to push his Old-Age Revolving Pension Plan, agreed it was necessary to elect a new representative for the Share Our Wealth program, someone who wouldn't be beholden to the president's whims. After much debate, it was decided that newly-elected Louisiana Congressman, Gerald L.K. Smith, is far enough removed from Long yet still dedicated to social security. As the votes were tallied in Smith's favour, the board pondered what Smith's association with the Silver Legion might mean in the future..."

unionstate.78.t:0 "Dixiecrats Declare AFP Corrupt"
unionstate.78.d:0 "After the end of hostilities in Washington, a large section of the conservative Democratic Party pledged their alligence to [Root.GetNameDef] and to the ideals President Long follows. Implicitly, these Democrats hoped Long would fulfil their desires for more state power in exchange for allowing Long's economic reforms to easily pass. This unwritten promise was broken when Long denied them the ability to enforce Prohibition, going so far as to ignore their impassioned speeches in favour of repealing the Interstate Commerce Act. Many conservative Democrats now see the AFP's regime as merely a sham democracy that rejects any measure the Long political machine will not personally benefit from. The President was still shocked, however, when the halls of Congress were only 3/4 full this week. Currently legislation is frozen, and it appears the so-called Dixiecrats are taking all their vacation days at once."
unionstate.78.a:0 "Fools, we are their only home."

unionstate.79.t:0 "The Officers' Revolt"
unionstate.79.d:0 "Despite our best efforts to incentivise officers to remain in their positions during this very sensivite time, approximately one hundred army officers have expressed deep reservations for Huey Long's trial. The press has reported these dissenting opinions, and thus have also given us warning of the officers' coming protest in the capital in five day's time. We have no illusions these marchers will be peaceful, or that their march won't culminate in a demand for the Silver Legion to return power to the AFP. General Patton, still leading the Fifth Army, has promised he will protect our right to rule the Commonwealth. Giving him free reign against the marchers, however, will be a bloody battle that could easily backfire on us. Richard Butler has suggested instead having Legion supporters infiltrate the marcher ranks and disrupt them from within. Better to make the officers look unreasonable and foolish than to make the government appear tyrannical."

unionstate.80.t:0 "Rebuilding the Constitution"
unionstate.80.d:0 "The Dixiecrats, who we tipped off about the 'arrest' of Long, have been useful in maintaining the facade that is Congress. The tedious proccess of replacing state representatives with Legionaries has meant that we have become more and more reliant on the Dixiecrats remaining content in the meantime. After a recent push by Chief Pelley to pass Amendments 22-24, bringing in a new "Grandfather" clause -depriving people of rights not enjoyed by their grandfather- and requiring a profession of faith in order to serve in Congress, the agenda has turned to Pelley's final amendment: reserving private and government land for redistribution to Christians. This has spawned a surprise backlash. The Dixiecrats claim this eminent domain impedes the rights of states to their own land, something Huey Long promised he wouldn't do. Chief Pelley is now in a bind. If he gives into the Dixiecrats, it will make him look weak at the very time he needs to look like he has all the answers. If he strongarms the amendment, as many of his advisers suggest, it dispels the illusion of democracy we so dearly need to maintain."

unionstate.81.d:0 "Resentment against the Silver Legion outpost in Baltimore has been building for the past several weeks. After a poorly-written passion play performed to entice membership was mocked in the city's newspapers, Legion members have begun to feel isolated from the community, and have begun travelling in armed groups. Tensions rose, and the breaking point came when the Baltimore police came upon a Legionaire lynching - and attacked the Legionaries. A full-blown riot in the streets has resulted, and the entire situation has been subsequently mishandled by the Maryland National Guard, who appear to not know which side to take. If we intervene to take the Legionaries out of the fighting, our favouritism will be obvious and it will cost us. If we leave them in the riots, however, it not only threatens to turn into a national scandal but might also call into question our loyalty to the Silver Legion. Still, some are suggesting this betrayal of our own could save face with the public by providing us the appearance of neutrality."
unionstate.81.a:0 "Abandon the Legionaries to their fate."

unionstate.82.d.death:0 "The riots in Baltimore went on for days before the Maryland National Guard was finally able to restore order. During that time, no real evidence was found of the Silver Legion's involvement in the entire debacle, and though the Silver Legion's headquarters in Baltimore was breached as important documents were still being disposed of, none of those papers found their way into the hands of anyone who could do damage. The entire incident was reported on as an attempted syndicalist coup against the Pelley administration, with the ensuing public sympathy providing plenty of leeway for government action to be taken against figures of suspect loyalty. This windfall of support has emboldend Pelley, who claims he predicted the outcome as biblical fact. Pelley recalled Herbert W. Armstrong to the capital, and has now announced a second book detailing his further predictions for America based on his reading of the bible. The Silver Legion, under Pelley's leadership, hopes to fufill the promises within this book in the coming years."
unionstate.82.d.mild:0 "The riots in Baltimore have petered out, though it appears not without making things uncomfortable for the administration. While dealing with the rioters, the Silver Legion headquarters in Baltimore was breached as important documents were still being disposed of. Papers were seized and somehow found their way into the hands of the newspapers, who published damning evidence of plans to restrict or outright remove the rights of African-Americans. Public outrage spread rapidly, but thankfully enough work had already been done to ensure loyalty in and outside of the adminstration. For weeks, denials were issued, stern investigations made, and several scapegoats offered... until finally the worst of it was passed. The political backlash has still damaged the people's faith in the Commonwealth, but the Silver Legion has placed enough loyalists within positions of power that we are now secure. They cannot dislodge us."
unionstate.82.d.freedom:0 "It appears the Maryland National Guard did their job too well. While dealing with the rioters, the Silver Legion headquarters in Baltimore was breached as important documents were still being disposed of. Papers were seized and somehow found their way into the hands of the newspapers, who have published evidence of a planned 'Black Belt' which would have put African-Americans under the Indian Reservation system. The outraged public has rallied resistance to Pelley's administration, and it appears out job was not complete... the Silver Legion does not have enough loyalists in position to keep the government safe. The radio is alive with talk of rebellion. Desperate AFP members to the young Charles Lindbergh, who has taken command along with several Business Plot members now freed from death row and offered the country a lifeline to hold onto before it plunges once again into chaos."

The inevitable occurred, though we can perhaps be thankful that Patton was fired on first. An angry officer shouted 'traitor' and then fired, and as Patton fell his line immediately opened fire. Hundreds died on each side, but even the most unreasonable newspaper is hesitant to suggest afterwards that Patton's men were doing anything more than trying to maintain order in a chaotic situation. Patton succumbed to his injuries two days later, and has all but been declared a martyr in the continuing battle against public disorder in America."
unionstate.83.a:0 "A true hero."

unionstate.84.t:0 "The Washington March"
unionstate.84.d:0 "The march on Washington happened just as was predicted - and while Butler's plan to have Legion members among the marchers went ahead as planned, the chaos they created was not nearly as effective as anyone hoped. While the plants managed to stop the march from gaining any momentum, preventing any attempt at a coup, it didn't stop a number of prominent officers from getting on stage and making impassioned speeches against the 'undemocratic' trial of Huey Long and the undermining of American democracy. Some newspapers mocked the chaos, but many others picked up on and spread the speeches, and the officers' words have reached the ears of many in the public who feel the same."

A second Declaration of Independence was drafted in Baton Rouge over the course of a few days, painstakingly emulating the original conceit of the American Revolution. This declaration outlined the lack of protection the federal government gave to citizens, and the role of the state to protect the welfare of the poor. The signatories declare that it is within their constitutional right to organize a militia against tyranny, and that the federal government's deadline should not only be ignored it must be defied."
unionstate.151.a:0 "Annuit coeptis."

unionstate.152.t:0 "The American Union State Congress Convenes"
unionstate.152.d:0 "Through the grapevine, dozens of congressmen have heard of Huey Long's assembly in Baton Rouge. Some came to wish Long well and stayed, others simply to court favour with the revolution. These meetings in Baton Rouge began to take on a Congressional appearance, with Coughlin standing as the President of the attending senators. Aware of the growing determination to defy the federal government, and that this lack of willingness to negotiate meant civil war was all but certain, a large number of politicians have slinked away to the north... though those that remain seem more determined than ever to see victory."
unionstate.152.a:0 "They'll get theirs!"

unionstate.153.t:0 "Deadline Looms"
unionstate.153.d:0 "As the federal government's deadline looms, it has become clear there will be no budging on either side. Across the part of the country controlled by Long's supporters, an army formed of militia and the Minutemen has been raised and a growing determination to see the country remade by force has taken hold. The federal government, in turn, has also made it clear they no longer see a path to compromise."
unionstate.153.a:0 "It is only a matter of time."

unionstate.500.t:0 "The Army Requisitions Civilian Trucks"
unionstate.500.d:0 "After Patton announced his Motorisation program for the new American Army, a proposal was sent to President Long to decide on the requisition of civilian vehicles in order to supply our fast-growing army. With his approval, we have begun seizing vehicles from the civilian populace, although to our surprise, some proud patriots line up next to our storages to volunteer their vehicles for the incoming fight. While not all their vehicles have proven to be useful for us, we have managed to requisition a fair amount of trucks which can either be modified to transport troops with ease or which are sturdy enough to transport our troops at once."

unionstate.501.t:0 "First Paradrop Exercise"
unionstate.501.d:0 "While technically speaking, the first paradropping excercises were practiced in 1930 with biplanes dropping machine gun squads, today a major breakthrough has been achieved in the airborne department. After finishing a rigorous conditioning and training program started two weeks ago, a lottery was made to decide the jumping order of the experimental paradropping platoon made up of volunteers. When the Douglas C-33 took off from the Lawson Air Field and finally was put into position to start the experiment, Second Lieutenant William T. Ryder became the first American Paratrooper after making his jump and landing near Fort Benning. The second man, however, refused to jump, and so the first enlisted man to become a paratrooper was Pvt. William N. "Red" King, and then the remaining 8 platoon members in the aircraft. After their touchdown, they quickly reached the rendezvous point and completed their excercise goals, making the experiment a success."
unionstate.501.a:0 "Start Scheduling New Jumps"

unionstate.502.t:0 "Formation of the First Paratrooper Divisions"
unionstate.502.d:0 "With the success of our scheduled mass jumps and with the blessing of General Patton, Fort Benning had begun taking volunteers for paratrooper units. While originally the high training standards and relatively high mortal risk initially caused few volunteers to show up, the high command authorized a triplication of the paratrooper wage as opposed to the foot soldier wage. Soon enough, the 501st Parachute Battalion was formed, quickly followed by other battalions and regiments. After a week recruitment, the number of volunteers was enough to form 5 paratrooper divisions for us to utilize. While these divisions still lack combat experience, this breakthrough in Airborne tactics should not be underestimated, and the High Command is looking forward to seeing their investment in these divisions pay off."

TEX_CLAIRE_LEE_CHENNAULT_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W September 6, 1890, in Commerce, Texas, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Claire Lee 'Old Leatherface' Chennault began his military career when he joined the Reserve Officers' Training Corps while he attended the Louisiana State University. He graduated from the Officers' School at Fort Benjamin Harrison in Indiana in 1917, and was transferred to the Aviation Division of the Army Signal Corps soon after. He earned his wings in 1919 and remained in service after the air branch was turned into the Air Corps. In 1931, he became Chief of Pursuit Section at Air Corps Tactical School, and would take charge of the 1st Pursuit Group of Alabama's Aerobatic Team, becoming a regional celebrity of his aerial feats. As 1937 loomed over, Chennault was considering resignation as the staff in Washington refused to promote him beyond Captain, considering him unfit for duty due to his declining health. When the American Civil War began, Chennault sided with the former Governor of Louisiana, giving Huey a small hike in recruitment as passionate observers of Chennault's performances filled the recruiting booths, and in exchange, Huey granted Chennault the honorary rank of Brigadier General for his service to the American Union State\n§YImportant Notes:§W- His health has been slowly deteriorating, with deafness and chronic bronchitis being the main issues Chennault will have to face sooner or later."
TEX_DADDY_COLLINS_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W May 1, 1896, in New Orleans, Louisiana, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Joseph Lawton 'Lightning Joe' Collins began his military career in 1913 when he joined West Point thanks to an alternate appointment his uncle Martin Behrman, the major of New Orleans at the time, managed to get him at the age of 17 and graduated as an infantry second lieutenant in 1917. He'd stay as a teacher in West Point and marry Gladys Easterbrook in his time at the academy. In 1921, he began teaching Chemistry in West Point as well and in 1926, he graduated from the company officer course at the Infantry School in Fort Benning. A year later, he'd undergo and successfully complete an advanced course at the Field Artillery School at Fort Sill. After that, Collins taught weapons and tactics at the Infantry School from 1927 to 1932 where he requested a transfer to the Philippine Division from 1933 to 1934 and became a major. In 1935 and 1936, he graduated from Army Industrial College and the Army War College reaching the rank of lieutenant colonel. With the outbreak of the Civil War, Collins aligned with Patton within the army, and both chose to leave southwards to join Huey Long's forces. When Patton was nominated as Field Marshall by Huey Long himself, Patton requested the promotion of Collins to Brigadier General which was granted by the Southern Demagogue.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- An extremely talented yet aggressive commanding officer, his skills shine the most when leading an attack on the enemy rather than playing on the defence."
TEX_COURTNEY_HODGES_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W 05 January, 1887, in Houston County, Georgia, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Courtney Hicks Hodges began his military career when he joined West Point in 1904, but was forced to drop out a year later due to his extremely poor academic performance. Undeterred, he enlisted in the army in 1906 as a private, where he quickly rose to the rank of sergeant in 1907 and earned a commission as a second lieutenant in 1909. He joined Pershing during the Punitive Expedition, where he met George S.

In 1934, graduated from the Army War College, earning him his promotion to lieutenant colonel. With Patton and Marshall vocally opposing MacArthur, Hodges was forced to choose between either one of his friends in case the situation deteriorated. He chose the former, as Patton managed to sway Hodges into joining him in the AUS Army, where the now Field Marshal Patton has offered his friend Hodges an early promotion to Brigadier General."

Simpson served with the General Staff until 1932 where he began teaching military science and tactics at Pomona College until 1936, being promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1934. As the country spiralled out of control, Simpson became more and more aligned with Huey Long's vision of America as time passed, and when Huey finally proclaimed the American Union State, Simpson presented his services to what he sees as the true American government. For his loyalty, Simpson was turned into a brigadier general."

In 1932, he was chosen to attend the Army War College and graduated on June 1933. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 26 February 1934. With the country spiralling into Civil War, Devers found himself fighting more and more against his superiors inability to react to internal issues, starting a deep rivalry between him and Dwight Eisenhower, even putting him at odds with his old friend Leslie McNair. When Huey Long declared the Union State, Devers decided that MacArthur and his staff was a liability for America, and promptly volunteered for the AUS officer corp, where he was promoted to Field Marshall along with George Patton."

After fulfilling a series of staff roles, mainly in Wyoming and Texas, he found himself strongly advocating for the mechanisation of the American Army along with Patton, which due to the army budget cuts, it became nothing more than a pipe dream for them. As Patton began to slowly drift away from the US Army staff, Hodes strengthened his ties with the 'Old Blood and Guts', and when Patton finally announced he was joining the Union States, Hodes accompanied him and was promoted to Brigadier General."
